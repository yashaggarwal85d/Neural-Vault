# Problem

- **Lack of Centralised System**
	- There is a need for a centralised system to manage and support all simulations for demand forecasting and related activities.
- **Algorithm Compatibility**
	- Existing algorithms for demand forecasting are written in different languages (Python and Matlab), making it difficult to manage and incorporate them into a unified system.
# Experience

- **Algorithm Development:** Developed algorithms in Python for demand forecasting, focusing on mathematical calculations.
- **Algorithm Conversion:** Converted algorithms from Matlab to Python to integrate them into the centralised system.
- **UI Development:** Built a user-friendly UI in Nextjs for configuring and managing algorithms.
- **Backend Development:** Developed the backend server in FastAPI to support the simulation application.
- **User Management:** Implemented complex user management features similar to Atlassian to manage user permissions effectively.
- **Alerting System:** Integrated an alerting system to monitor and notify users about the execution of algorithms, metrics, graphs, and reporting.

# Results

- **Centralized System:** Successfully developed a centralized system, named simulations, to manage, execute, and support all simulations for demand forecasting and related activities.
- **Unified Algorithm Environment:** Integrated algorithms from different sources into a unified system, enhancing compatibility and ease of management.
- **User-Friendly UI:** Created a user-friendly UI in Next.js, allowing users to easily configure and manage simulations.

# Learning

- **Algorithm Integration:** Learned how to integrate algorithms written in different languages into a unified system.
- Mathematics behind demand forecasting in TI.
- Demand management domain knowledge.
