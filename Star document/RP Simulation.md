# Problem

* **Reactive Manufacturing Decisions**
    - Currently, TIâ€™s manufacturing decisions are based on customer demand, leading to:
        - Lower utilisation during downturns
        - Inability to meet increased demand during upturns

- **Target Generation and Segmentation**
    - Algorithms in the RP ecosystem ensure:
        - Right quantity for consistently selling products with broad customer base
    - Validation is time-consuming, requiring multiple SCP Engine runs.
    - Having right mixture of the products (segmentation)

- **RP Simulation**
    - Utilizes System Dynamics Simulation
    - Calculates inventory levels and other outputs for any time period using:
        - Targets
        - Customer demand
        - Manufacturing capacity
# Experience

- **UI Design in React**
- **Code Efficiency**
    - Writing and maintaining clean, efficient code
- **Documentation**
    - Creating comprehensive user guides and Confluence documents
    - Developing architecture diagrams
- **DevOps**
    - Deploying CI/CD pipeline for RP Simulation UI
        - Designing Jenkins Pipeline for Continuous Integration
        - Creating Docker container for application deployment on the server

# Results

* Equipped business users in making the right manufacturing decisions to utilise the manufacturing capacity more effectively.
* The time required for validating new target generation algorithms would be reduced from several months to a few minutes, with the use of the simulation tool.
* Days of inventory is a key financial metric conveyed to investors. This tool would ensure that we stay within the DOI limits by monitoring inventory levels generated in different scenarios
* Reducing the number of stock-outs based on the results from the simulation, would lead to better customer experience.
* Won Rising star of the quarter award for my contributions to this project.

# Learning

* Practical implementation of Software development lifecycle. 
* Domain Knowledge of Demand management in TI.
