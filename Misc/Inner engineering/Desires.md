* Desires are necessary as without them we are just a meat shell.
	* Our mind give desires its meaning.
	* Not desiring anything is itself is a desire.
	* Human being is made up of consciousness which is a part of the universe and this consciousness wants all that is there in the universe.
		* The desires which is just a product of our thoughts and consciousness is itself unlimited.
		* It will never end because it does not want more, **it wants all**.
* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Control on our desires are necessary.</mark>
	* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Compulsive desires are dangerous.</mark>
	* Without the control of desires, we will be considered **insane**.
* While playing a game we should be **focussed on the game not the result.**
