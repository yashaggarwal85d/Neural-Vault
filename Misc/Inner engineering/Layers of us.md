# Idea

* There are 5 layers of human being - 
	* Physical in nature
		* Physical body
			* Do **Gym, Yoga and proper diet** for alignment.
		* Mental body
			* Do creative stuff like music and dancing, **less addictions** and more work for alignment.
		* Energy body
			* Do **meditation** for alignment
	* Non physical
		* Intelligence body
			* **Each cell in our body possess intelligence**, not just mind.
			* Required for transition from physical to non physical.
			* Spine is the most important part of the body, it has access to the universe.
		* Blissfulness
			* Can only be unlocked when all the physical bodies are aligned
