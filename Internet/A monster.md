# Idea

- Google did a plot analysis of the typical pornographic female fantasy and found common themes.
    - The female fantasy often involves an innocent woman encountering a male who is a bit of a **monster**, such as a vampire, werewolf, billionaire, pirate, or surgeon.
	- The basic plot is that the **woman tames the aggressive male**, reflecting the female hero myth.
    - This myth suggests that <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">there is no fun in taming someone who is already tame </mark>and that aggression, though dangerous, is necessary and must be civilised.
	- The archetypal female in these fantasies seduces and tames the aggressive male, representing her encounter with chaos.
- Agreeable vs disagreeable 
	- If you ask a disagreeable person what he wants, say, or she wants, they'll tell you right away. 
		- They know. It's like "This is what I want and this is how I'm gonna get it." 
	- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Agreeable people, are so agreeable, that they often don't even know what they want. </mark>
		- Cause they're so accustomed to living for other people
		- Finding out what other people want, and to trying to make them comfortable, and so forth
		- Its harder for them to find a sense of their own desires as they move through life.

* Virtuous
	* **If you're harmless, you're not virtuous**. You're just harmless. You're like a rabbit. 
		* A rabbit isn't virtuous. It just can't do anything except get eaten. 
	* <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">If you're a monster and you don't act monstrously, then you're virtuous. </mark>
	* So it's very peculiar, but it's a very common mythological notion. 
		* The hero has to be a monster. 
		* But a controlled monster. 
		* Batman is like that.
	* If you're going to be a fighter, you have to want to win and you have to want to hurt people. 
		* Not for the sake of hurting them. 
		* That's what makes you different than an evil person. 
		* **But you have to have that capacity.** 
		* You have to develop that. 
	* <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Your monstrousness is actually the best guarantee of peace. </mark>
		* If you are not capable of Cruelty you are absolutely a victim to anyone who is

# Examples

* Assume a Agreeable person and disagreeable person is playing a trading game
	* If you're very agreeable, then **you're gonna bargain harder on my behalf than you're gonna bargain on your own behalf**. 
		* You will think - at best, at worst this has to be 50/50
		* Probably will get exploited
	* Whereas if you're disagreeable, you're gonna do the reverse. You're gonna think "I'm in this trading game for me, and you're gonna take care of your own interest." 
* Harry potter is a monster
	* He's flawed, he's hurt. 
	* He's got evil in him. 
	* He can talk to snakes. 
	* He breaks rules all the time.
	* He's not obedient at all. 
	* But, you know, he has a good reason for breaking the rules
