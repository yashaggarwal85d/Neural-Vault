# Idea

* Create Authenticity
    - Sharing embarrassing stories and <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">calling out awkward moments</mark> helps create authenticity in conversations.
    - If you make out mistakes during the conversation, acknowledge that and invite people to laugh at with you.
    - <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Compliment authenticity</mark> when you see it in others to encourage more genuine interactions.
	    - Don't be an authenticity police and call out every time, doing it rarely is enough.
* Make People Feel Good Around You
    - Show **genuine admiration** for others to make them feel good about themselves.
	    - If you see something genuinely good in someone, tell them.
	    - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Don't be fake</mark>
	    - Mix in good-natured teasing to balance compliments and avoid seeming like a suck-up.
    - Compliment authenticity and combine compliments with jokes to create lighthearted moments.
    - Take time to acknowledge and appreciate everyone, especially the people who normally gets ignored.
* Be **Playfully Humble**
    - Respond to compliments with playfully humble remarks to show humility and appreciation.
    - Balance playful humility with genuine appreciation for compliments.

# Examples

* Calling out Awkward moments
	- "Awkward silence, huh? Glad we're on the same page."
	- "I have to admit something, I didn't tried the suit on before I came out and I just realised its so tight" - Ryan Gosling.

* Playfully Humble
	* Oh, thank you, but I must confess, I have my moments of sheer mediocrity.
	* Oh, you think I'm talented? You should see me try to dance. It's like watching a baby giraffe on ice skates
	* Yeah, I guess I'm okay with Piano. I mean, I can play 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star'... most of the time
