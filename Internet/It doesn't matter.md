# Idea

* Self-Validation
    - Internalise that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">you don't need external approval to feel confident.</mark>
    - Maintain perspective and realise that **most situations are not life or death**.
    - Believe that you'll be okay no matter what happens in a conversation or interaction.
* Building Confidence
    - Believe that you can go into any social situation and be okay, even if things don't go as planned.
    - **You don't need anything** from the conversation, you are just there to have fun
	    - You may be expecting a certain result from a conversation or a reaction, keep in mind that you want it and not need it.
	    - <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Want it and not need it</mark>

# Examples

* Self Validation
	* people see someone they're attracted to and they freeze up heart racing breath quickening unable to muster the courage to say anything
	* Realise that You don't need anything from it, you want that person to be attracted to you as well but you don't need.
