| Most people assume the relationship between effort and reward is one-to-one.                                                                               | Most activities in life do not operate along the linear effort/reward curve                            | The inverted curve is the bizarro “Twilight Zone” curve where effort and reward have a negative correlation                                                                                                                     |
| We think that working twice as long will produce twice the results.                                                                                        | Because most activities in life are not basic nor mindless.                                            | The more effort you put into doing something, the more you will fail to do it.                                                                                                                                                  |
| That caring about a relationship twice as much will make everyone feel twice as loved. That yelling your point twice as loud will make you twice as right. | Most activities are complex, mentally and/or emotionally taxing, and require adaptation.               | When we consciously try to create a state of mind, the desire for that state of mind creates a different and often opposite state of mind from the one we’re trying to create.                                                  |
| There are very little activities that have a linear curve                                                                                                  | <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Most activities produce a diminishing returns curve</mark>        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Effort and reward have a linear relationship when the action is mindless and simple                                                                        | Effort and reward have a diminishing returns relationship when the action is complex and multivariate. | <mark style="background: #F23423;font:#000000">when the action becomes purely psychological</mark> (an experience that exists solely within our own consciousness) the relationship between effort and reward becomes inverted. |
 **The harder we try with the conscious will to do something, the less we shall succeed. Proficiency and results come only to those who have learned the paradoxical art of doing and not doing, or combining relaxation with activity**
# Examples

* There’s a part of Navy SEAL training called “drown-proofing” where they bind your hands behind your back, tie your feet together, and dump you into a 9-foot-deep pool.
	* The first lesson of drown-proofing is paradoxical
		* **The more you struggle to keep your head above water, the more likely you are to sink.**
		* The trick to drown-proofing is to actually let yourself sink to the bottom of the pool. 
			* From there, you lightly push yourself off the pool floor and let your momentum carry you back to the surface to grab a breath.
	* The second lesson of drown-proofing is a bit more obvious, but also paradoxical
		* **The more you panic, the more oxygen you will burn and the more likely you are to fall unconscious and drown.**
		* In a sick and twisted way, the exercise turns your survival instinct against you
			* The more intense your desire to breathe, the less you will be able to breathe. 
			* The more intense your will to live, the greater the chance you will die.
* Diminishing returns
	* Drinking, sex, weed any kind of addiction
	* The number of showers you take in a day
	* Taking vacations, hiring employees, consuming caffeine, saving for retirement, scheduling business meetings, playing video games
	* Practically any aspect of your life
* Studies on work productivity show that we’re really only productive for the first four to five hours of each day
		* Everything after that suffers severely diminished returns, to the point where the difference between working for 12 hours and 16 hours is basically nothing
* Inverted returns
	* Pursuing happiness takes you further away from it. 
	* Attempts at greater emotional control only remove us from it. 
	* The desire for greater freedom is often what causes us to feel trapped. 
	* The need to be loved and accepted prevents us from loving and accepting ourselves.
	* A dog can never catch her own tail. 
		* The more she chases, the more her tail seems to run away. 
		* That’s because the dog lacks the perspective to realise that she and the tail are the exact same thing.
