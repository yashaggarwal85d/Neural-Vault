# Idea

* There are three characters that live inside our brain - 
	- The **Rational Decision-Maker**
		- The Rational Decision-Maker makes the **rational decision to do something productive.** 
		- He wants to take information into account and have you do whatever makes best sense to do right now.
		- The Rational Decision-Maker gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do:
			- Visualise the future
			- See the big picture
			- Make long-term plans

	- The **Instant Gratification Monkey**
		- The Instant Gratification Monkey **lives entirely in the present moment**. 
		- He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he only cares about two things: easy and fun. 
		- In tribal times, the Monkey worked well. It cares about sleeping, eating, and propagating. 
		- But in advanced civilisation, the Monkey fails us. It causes us to avoid the hard things required to live a life of meaning.

	- Conflict - 
		- Sometimes it makes logical sense to be doing things that are easy and fun ⇒ This causes the Rational Decision Maker and the Monkey to agree ⇒ this leads to awesome play and fun times.
		- But other times it makes sense to do harder and less fun things ⇒ this situation causes conflict ⇒ and the Monkey often wins ⇒ when the Monkey whens, we procrastinate.
		- When we procrastinate, easy and fun activities happen when they are not supposed to be happening ⇒ This leads to fun that isn’t actually fun (Note: time spent procrastinating leads to guilt, dread, anxiety, and self-hatred).
	
	- The **Panic Monster**
		- The Panic Monster is dormant most of the time, but he wakes up anytime:
			- A deadline gets too close, or
			- There’s danger of public embarrassment.
			- The Monkey fears the Panic Monster
				- When the Panic Monster shows up, the Monkey cedes control to the Rational Decision-Maker.

* There are two types of procrastination:

	1. Procrastination on hard things _with deadlines_
		* we naturally deal with it
		* effects of procrastination are short term
		* because the Panic Monster gets involved when deadlines near. 
	2. Procrastination on hard things _without deadlines_
		* **dangerous** because there are no deadlines
		* so the Panic Monster never gets triggered
		* We are allowed to procrastinate forever.
		* Its often less visible
			* it’s usually suffered quietly and privately which leads to long-term unhappiness and regret.
		* **Your life is the ultimate deadline**
		* Keep the finiteness of your time on this planet in mind to create deadlines for yourself when they don’t exist externally.

# Examples

* We all experience the second type of procrastination
	* If you’re entrepreneurial, there are no deadlines at first
	* nothing's happening (until you've gone out and done the hard work to get things going). 
	* Personal examples of things without deadlines include:
		1. Seeing your family
	1. Exercising
	2. Eating well
	3. Building new relationships
