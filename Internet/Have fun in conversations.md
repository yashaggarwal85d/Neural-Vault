# Idea

* Go into conversations with the intention to have fun rather than seeking approval.
	- Playing with **absurd analogies** can make conversations more enjoyable.
    - Use the **Mind's Eye method** to create vivid and ridiculous mental images.
    - **Deadpan humour** can be effective but be careful to ensure it's understood as a joke.
	    - Its relying on the irony of the situation for comedic effect.
	    - A smirk before the joke can really help.
    - The **fake walk-off** is a low-effort way to get a laugh.
* Tell Funny Embarrassing Stories
    - **Share funny, embarrassing stories** from your past to appear more confident and relatable.
    - Emphasise that you're aware the story is embarrassing, inviting others to laugh with you.
    - Choose lighthearted stories where no one was deeply harmed.

# Examples

* Absurd Analogies
	- It looks So bad its like staring at the sun directly.
	- Trying to understand quantum physics without a degree is like trying to teach a goldfish calculus.
	- Her singing voice was like a cat being strangled by a bagpipe.
	- The meeting dragged on longer than a sloth's commute.
	- Her cooking skills were about as reliable as a squirrel driving a car.

* Mind Eye's method
	* The office kitchen after the potluck was like a war zone, with food remnants scattered everywhere like casualties.
	* His attempt at flirting was like watching a penguin trying to flyâ€”awkward, but strangely endearing.
	* Normal Conversation -  "I need to organise my schedule better."
		* With Mind's Eye - "My schedule is so disorganised, it's like a squirrel's nest after a hurricane!"
	* Normal Conversation -  "She was laughing very hard."
		* With Mind's Eye - "Her laughter echoed through the room, contagious and joyful, like a chorus of cheerful birds greeting the morning sun"
* Deadpan Humour
	* I'm on a whiskey diet. I've lost three days already.
	* Oh, great. Another Monday. My favourite day of the week.
	* I love standing in line for hours. It's the highlight of my day.
	* I told my wife she should embrace her mistakes. She gave me a hug.
