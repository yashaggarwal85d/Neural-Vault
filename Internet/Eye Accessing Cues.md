# Idea

Eye Accessing Cues in NLP  (Neurolinguistics Programming) relates to the various eye movements in certain directions that indicate whether an individual has primarily visual, auditory or kinaesthetic thinking
##### Visual
Visual people they rely heavily on visuals to understand, deliver and communicate.
- I **see** what you mean
- I can’t **imagine** it
- Do you **see** my point?
##### Auditory
Auditory people rely heavily on audio for processing and delivering information.
- I **hear** you
- **Sounds** like a plan
- I like the **sound** of that

##### Kinaesthetic
Kinaesthetic people are people who rely on touch and feel as a representation system.
- This **feels** right
- This idea doesn’t **sit** well with me
- I **feel** that..

##### Auditory Digital
Similar to the definition of boolean in IT, an auditory digital person is someone who sees things as black and white, or 0 or 1
- This doesn’t **make sense**
- It’s either **X or Y**

looking left is lying and right is truth, reverse for left handed people

### **Be the Kinaesthetic type**
Express your feelings, your interests, stories and who you are the best and most exciting and comfortable way you can.
