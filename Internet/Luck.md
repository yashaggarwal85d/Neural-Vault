- Luck is a probability, a chance, an opportunity.
	- If you stand by doing nothing, the probability will decrease, the opportunity will be missed.
- No matter is luck is on your side, if you are not prepared for it, its no use.
- Don’t treat luck as an unavoidable factor, an excuse to dream dope.
- Put the right amount of effort in the right direction and you will see the results.
- “<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">The goddess of fortune only smiles down on ones who favours her</mark>"
	- If you want to be lucky, work hard, make smart decisions, show the goddess that you are worth having her blessings.
