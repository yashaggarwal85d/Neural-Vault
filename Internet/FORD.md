# Idea

* FORD is a simple framework to build long lasting friendships with people after only couple of conversation exchanges.
	* F - Family
		* <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">When people share Family related matters with strangers, they feel significantly closer to them afterwards</mark>
		* Never ask someone about their family upfront, it can come out as very strong
			* Make it like topic of family naturally pops up.
				* **Talk about your family first**
				* **Non-Sequitur** - Making assumptions about something. 
	* O - Occupation
		* Generally while taking about occupation, people asks question after question after question
			* This is called <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">interview mode</mark> and its a very boring area
		* **Instead add your comments after every answer.**
		* When you meet a stranger, talking about occupation first is usually the best bet.
	* R - Recreation
		* **What do you like to do in your free time?**
			* This is the most common and effective question to ask about they recreational activities.
		* When you ask this question, approach with the mindset of - 
			* <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Why is this Activity exciting for her</mark>
			* This attitude with make the conversation exciting.
			* This makes them feel like they are being listened to.
	* D - Dreams
		* Everyone have dreams, that they want to pursue or wish they would have pursued.
			* This is a very important and most powerful topic.
				* Average person does not get to pursue their dream
				* They instead end up working conventional jobs
		* **If you show the other person that you are supportive of their dream, they will become fond of you.**
		* Dreams is the last topic you would want to touch.
			* Start this conversation when you feel like you share a connection.
		* **You might get a hint from the recreation activity what might their dream may be**
			* Use this information to make an educated guess

# Examples

* Family
	* There is someone at the part who is dancing crazily on the floor, you can say 
		* You see that guy over there, its crazy how he is dancing, my brother is like that, he is not afraid to dance like that. Do you have any siblings?
			* If not, ask if you ever wish did you have one?
	* Hey, you look like you come from a big family
* Occupation
	* Don't interrogate someone by asking
		* What do you do?
		* Where do you work at?
		* How much time you spend there?
		* blah blah blah
	* Instead if they tell you they are a teacher, you can pass a comment on teachers
		* Like - Teachers are inspiring people, they nurture a human being at a very early stage in life which practically defines our whole life.
* Recreation
	* If they say they like rock climbing
		* Try to ask and understand what is that they like about it?
* Dream
	* If they say they like to draw.
		* Ask them if they would like to become an artist?
	* What is something you wanna do before you die?
