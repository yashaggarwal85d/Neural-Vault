* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Honesty boosts confidence</mark> like nothing else. 
	* If you have nothing to hide or lie about, you automatically become super confident because you have nothing to be nervous about.
* Sometimes, in an attempt to make a story more captivating, you starts fabricating elements.
	* You believe that you are enhancing its appeal, but in reality, you are just diminishing its authenticity. 
	* The story begins to feel contrived and detached from reality, losing its genuine essence.
* Honesty should be maintained. 
	* Its a <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">crucial characteristic of a formidable man. </mark>
	* Its a noble virtue, and it often serves as a foundation for trust in any relationship
* **In case you bend the truth or hide it, the reasons should be strong**.
	* Sometimes, a well-placed omission or a little creative interpretation can spare someone unnecessary pain or protect their delicate sensibilities. 
	* While a little white lie or bending of the truth may be justified in certain situations, one should always tread lightly and be mindful of the consequences.
* **Deception, when abused, can erode trust and lead to more trouble than it's worth.**
