# Idea

* Wu Wei translates to 'not forcing' or 'non-action'.
    - Many think Wu Wei means to do nothing, to be lazy, or passive, which is incorrect.
	- Wu Wei involves <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">action but only at the right moment</mark>.
	- It emphasises<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> naturalness and spontaneity without forcing efforts.</mark>
- In any artistic performance (dance, acting, music), forced actions are immediately noticeable and deemed unnatural.
	- True artistry is achieved through unforced, natural expression.
- Wu Wei is about aligning with the natural flow of life.
- Types of Virtues - 
    - **Superior Virtue** has no intention of being virtuous and thus is virtuous.
    - **Inferior Virtue**: Tries too hard to be virtuous, thus failing.
- <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Real Wu Wei is not intentionally Wu Wei and thus is Wu Wei</mark>
- Humans tend to act in ways that are counterproductive. 
	- And in their <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">attempts to alter the natural way, they only make things worse</mark>.
	- Most of the times problem seeks to solve themselves.
	- Our actions only make things worse
- We also call Wu Wei, the flow state or effortless action.
	- Its a state of action and not try.
# Examples

* Judo: Use muscle only when your opponent is off balance, not prematurely.\
* Wu Wei is akin to sailing (working with the wind) rather than rowing (working against the water).
* Those who stand on tiptoes do not stand firmly.
* Those who rush ahead don't get very far.
* **Those who try to outshine others dim their own light.**
* More desperate you are more you will not get it.
