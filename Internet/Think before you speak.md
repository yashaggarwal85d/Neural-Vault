# Idea

* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Words hold the power to wound or heal,</mark> to build bridges or destroy them. 
	* Its akin to wielding a finely crafted blade, sharp and lethal but to be used carefully.

* The art of restraint -
	- Speaking only when necessary, imbues your words with a certain mystique and weight.
		- The fewer the strikes, the sharper the edge
		- The less you speak the more valuable your words become, blurbing out anything will only make you look like an idiot.
	- In a world awash with chatter, those who choose their words wisely and sparingly are often the ones who command attention and respect.
	- Losers speaks because they have to say something
		- men speaks only when they have something to say.
	- Silence can be your greatest ally, allowing your words to resonate with greater impact when they do emerge from the shadows.
