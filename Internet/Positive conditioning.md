# Idea

* Positively conditioning someone is a bit like playing a tune on a finely-tuned piano. You want to use the right keys to create a harmonious melody
* We want to condition their subconscious mind to always respect you and think before speaking to you.

* Positively reinforcing has some aspects to it -
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Punishing with ignorance</mark>. 
		- Ignorance speaks louder than any words.
	- Communicate clearly that the behaviour that they have just demonstrated is not tolerable.
	- Reward the behaviour you want to encourage. 
		- Praise, compliments, and tangible rewards can work wonders in reinforcing desired actions.
	- Be consistent in positive or negative feedback
	- Have Empathy
	- Reacting with frustration or irritation to disrespect may inadvertently reinforce negative behaviours, It could unintentionally condition the other person to continue teasing or disrespecting you, as they may find it amusing or entertaining.
