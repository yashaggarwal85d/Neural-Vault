# Idea

* Whenever given a complement
	* First, give a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">heartfelt thank you</mark>, show that you appreciate the words
	* Second, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Redirect the complement</mark> to the giver or someone else present there or someone you think that share the credit.
		* If there is a moment where there seems no one to redirect the praise to, reply it with humour.
* Worst things to do when given complement
	* Docking complements entirely
	* Telling them that they are wrong
	* Silence or ignorance
	* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Arrogant replies</mark> like "I know that"
# Examples

* Keanu reeves always redirects praise towards others.
	* When getting an award he praises his directors and fellow actors
	* When in interviews when someone complements him he redirects the praise to the interviewer or fellow colleagues.
* If someone says you did a good work, respond with "only because you were there to support me".
* Keanu reeves reply with humour when there is no one to deflect the praise towards.
	* "What is your secret for always staying so down to earth", he replied "Gravity".
