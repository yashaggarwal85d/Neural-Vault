# Idea

* Handling office politics
	* When someone behaves a certain way that you don't like
		* Step back and ask yourself 
			* Why are they doing that? 
			* <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">What could be the reason that they are doing so? </mark>
				* Don't make it about you. 
				* Make it about them. 
			* What is it that they know that you don't?
			* What is it that is possibly driving them that has nothing to do with you? 
			* What is their personal agenda that you don't know about?
		* Create those possibilities in your head. 
			* Whenever you are facing that issue, apply these possibilities and find which one could it be? 
			* **In most cases, you are not the centre of the case**
				* you are not the part of the case. 
			* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">You are over-imagining the things. </mark>
	* Report.
		* Will the leaders in the organisation also behave the same way?
			* Because the values and culture of the organisation comes from there
		* Will they be happy or sad or indifferent if they got to know whats going on?
			* Situation 1: They will truly care and try to solve the problem you have. 
				* Resolution: **Report**.
			* Situation 2: They won't care and will probably think that something is wrong with you
				* Resolution: Its the time to divert your efforts to something greater good (**Switch**).  
	* Don't indulge yourself in **rumours**. 
		* You will be a part of the problem then.
		* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Back bitching</mark> is always bad where its office space or not
			* It will come around and bite you back
