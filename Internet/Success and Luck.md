# Idea

* **People think it has to be either skill or luck that explains success, but the truth is you need both.**
	* If <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">we are just a product of our circumstances</mark> then our hard work and our talent seem to count for nothing.
		* This makes people overlook luck.
* Â There may be another benefit to overlooking your lucky breaks
	* It makes it easier to justify your place in society.
		*  It makes it easier to accept inequality.
	* If you have a lot of wealth or power, you can just chalk it up to your own intelligence, effort, and perseverance.
* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Our circumstances and psychology conspire to make us oblivious to our own luck.</mark>
	* **Once you have achieved a certain status, it seems natural to feel like you deserve it** and all the other good things that come your way.
	* This leads successful people to view the world as fair and those less successful than them as less talented or less hard-working.
* <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Leaders who give circumstances and luck the credit are viewed as more humble and respected than who does not.</mark>
* **Raising our awareness of fortunate events can also make us happier because it allows us to feel gratitude**.
* The mindset to have to be successful is paradoxical
	* First - <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">you must believe that you are in complete control of your destiny and that your success comes down only to your own talent and hard work</mark>.
	* Second - **you've got to know that's not true for you or anyone else**.
		* Always give luck and circumstances some credit.

# Examples

* Small chances can determine our whole life
	* If you ask a professional hockey player how they managed to reach the NHL
		* They might mention their hard work, determination, great coaches and so on
		* but they probably won't acknowledge how lucky they were to be born in January. 
	* And yet, in many years 40% of hockey players selected into top tier leagues are born in the first quarter of the year, compared to just 10% in the fourth quarter
		* And the reason for this disparity is presumably because the cutoff date for kids hockey leagues is January 1st.
		* Those born in the first part of the year are a little older and so on average bigger and faster than kids in their league born late in the year.
		* The young kids who share the most promise are given more time on the ice and enter more tournaments, where they receive better coaching and improve their skills. And **these advantages compound year after year**
			* so by the time you get to the pros, birthdays are heavily skewed towards the start of the year.
* Probably the **most significant bit of luck many of us enjoy is being born into a prosperous country**
	* Around half the variance in income received by people around the world is explained by their country of residence and that country's income distribution.
	* If you were born in Burundi, for example, which has the world's lowest gross national income per capita of just 730 dollars a year.
		* It doesn't matter how smart or hard-working you are
		* You're unlikely to earn much as an adult.
