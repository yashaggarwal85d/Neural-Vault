# Idea

Its a cognitive bias in which states - 

| **People who are less knowledgable and experienced in an area**                     | **Those who are knowledgable and experience in an area**                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| believe that they are much more competent than they actually are                    | underestimate or doubt their abilities                                                         |
| They don't have the enough experience to recognise the degree of their incompetence | These people are skilled and have the detailed knowledge of the area to know the undiscovered. |
| They don't know enough to know what they do not know                                |                                                                                                |
| Most confident and loudest people                                                   | Less loud, simplistic, thoughtful and cautious.                                                |
<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Overestimating or underestimating our or others abilities are very common</mark>
People can never know they are victim to this effect.
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">We can overcome this effect by being more regularly being silent, by being willing to be a nobody, to let our voice, our  presence, our existence not always be involved.</mark>
Life  is a continuous cycle of realising how little you knew, how much you were wrong, and how complex  things really are. And then, realising it again.
