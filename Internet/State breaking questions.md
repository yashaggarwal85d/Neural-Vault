# Idea

* When we're under pressure our natural response is to go with the flow and passively accept the conversational Pace set by someone who's in a position of power over us.
	* However in doing so we surrender our power during that conversation which in a negotiation usually leads to an unfavourable deal
* The <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">state-breaking question is a seemingly out of place question that breaks the one-sided conversational flow</mark> and from there conversation is much easier to steer in a New Direction
* But make sure to not allow anyone else to use this
	* When someone says any state breaking question, don't divert from it.
	* **Simply continue down the original path rather than answering them.**
* This can be used even when someone is down or feeling upset
	* Asking a random lighthearted question can break their state for long enough for them to consider more empowering possibilities
