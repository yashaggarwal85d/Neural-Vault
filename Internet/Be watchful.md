# Idea

- Be watchful
	- It's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">really useful to investigate the viewpoints of people who have opposing views to yours.</mark>
	- Because they'll tell you things you don't know
		- They'll also tell you how to see the world in ways that you don't see it.
		- And they'll also have skills that you don't have, that you could develop.
