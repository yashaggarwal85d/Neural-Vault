# Idea

* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Excessive indulgence in anything, whether it is considered as good or bad, can have negative repercussions</mark>. 
* Excessiveness, even in things that may seem positive, can have detrimental effects on our well-being.
* Everything has a limit of intake. If you exceed that limit, you will definitely run into trouble. 
	* Bad things generally have a smaller limit and good things tend to have higher. 
	* Try to find that limit for anything that you do or consume, balancing these little things is called life.

# Examples

- Take alcohol, for instance. 
	- Enjoying a drink once in a while may not pose significant harm, but if it becomes a daily habit, it can wreak havoc on your liver and overall health.
- Similarly, consuming sweets in moderation is harmless. 
	- However, if you make them a staple of your daily diet, it can lead to weight gain, dental issues, and an increased risk of chronic conditions like diabetes.
- Love, undoubtedly a beautiful emotion, can bring immense joy and fulfilment. 
	- But when love turns into an obsession and you become overly dependent on someone, it can lead to disappointment, heartbreak, and a loss of self-identity.
- Social Media: Engaging in social media can be a great way to connect and stay informed. 
	- However, spending excessive hours mindlessly scrolling through feeds can lead to reduced productivity, isolation, and negative impacts on mental health.
- Exercise: Regular exercise is essential for maintaining physical fitness and overall well-being.
	- Yet, pushing yourself to the extreme without allowing adequate rest and recovery can result in injuries, exhaustion, and burnout.
- Work: Dedication to one's profession is admirable, but becoming a workaholic can negatively affect personal relationships, lead to chronic stress, and undermine mental and physical health.
- Perfectionism: Striving for excellence can be motivating, but obsessively pursuing perfection in every aspect of life can lead to anxiety, self-doubt, and a constant fear of failure.
