# Idea

* If anything is available in abundance, the value decreases. 
* <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Laugh too much or too often can make your laugh come out as abundant or cheap</mark>.
	* If your laugh can be earned with a small joke then it does not worth anything to anyone.
	* Be smart enough to know when to laugh and when not.
* Adding a touch at an appropriate position while laughing works like a charm. 
	* It makes the person getting touched comfortable. 
	* It will induce trust and likeness.
