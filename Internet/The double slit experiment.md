# Idea

* The double-slit experiment is a famous experiment in quantum physics that helps us understand the behaviour of light and particles. 
	* Not only that it further **explains the nature of reality of this universe** and lay a basic foundation of the quantum physics.
    
- Prerequisites
	- Photon can behave like a particle as well as wave
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Every particle can be broken down into atoms and every atom can be broken down into waves.</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Universe is made up of waves and frequencies.</mark>
    
- SetUp
	- A barrier with two narrow slits is placed in front of a screen. 
	- Light or particle gun is placed in front of it, a screen at he back of the slit to detect the pattern of the light or particle.

- Firing beam of protons continuously
	- We will observe the pattern similar to the two waves coinciding and having constructive and destructive interference

- Firing one proton at a time
	- When one proton is fired at a time it should not have the constructive or destructive interference
		- so it should but print the energy of the photon in the straight line like a bullet **but this does not happens.**
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The same wave pattern as previous is seen when proton is fired one at a lime over a long period of time</mark>.
		- Each photon dumps its energy at a single point, the pattern emerges in the distribution of final positions of completely unrelated photons.
		- Each photon has no idea where the previous photon landed or where the future photon will land, yet each photon land exactly where it should be.
		- This happen not just with proton but almost any type of particle or entity.
    
- The Copenhagen interpretation
	- The theory that prevails over this experiment is that the particle exist as a wave of possibilities. 
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Only when the particle is observed the final position and the path to get there is decided</mark>
		- **All the possibilities exists simultaneously** when the particle is fired, it is only decided in an instant where the particle will end up. 
		- The randomness of the particle cannot be decided, the possibilities cannot be calculated before hand. 
		- This concludes that the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">future is not decided until it happens.</mark>
    
- What happens if we place an observer
	- by placing a detector at the two slits to try to figure out which slit the individual atoms are going through, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">they all of a suddenly stop behaving like waves, and behave like particles.</mark>
	- Its was assumed that maybe the photon emitted by the detector messes up the proton movement that results in the particle like interference but its not entirely true.
		- The existence of the detector does not affect the interference but the detection itself, if the detection is turned off the behaviour return to wave like.
	- Copenhagen interpretation holds true here as well, if we observes the proton before it hits the screen its probability is determined at that instant. 
		- When it is not measured, is not distinct.

- Where is it measured?
	- Does measurement take place at the instrument that measures it? 
	- Does measurement necessarily require a consciousness? 
	- This is called the “**measurement problem** of quantum mechanics.” 
		- Physicists do not universally agree on a resolution.

# Interpretations

* Von Neumann–Wigner interpretation
	- This says that in the long chain of measurement, the collapse occurs at the moment that a **consciousness** interprets the measurement. 
	- The consciousness of the physicist is making the particle distinct. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">And without this consciousness, the atom would just be a wave of probabilities.</mark>
    
- Many worlds interpretation
	- This theory postulates that there is NEVER any collapse, that we may be a measuring it in our reality, but there is no measurement happening in a different reality, and the wave function continues in that different branch of reality. But at some branch of reality, the particle collapse never actually happens.
    
- Conclusion
	- This experiment started simply as a method to prove the wave like nature of all the elements but ended up questioning the nature of reality
		- Does our consciousness creates the reality or **there are many worlds when the reality is different and which world will pick up which reality is decided.** 
		- Both of the theories are intriguing. 
		- One Von Neumann theory supports the power of conscious mind and the many world theory supports the existence of the parallel worlds with different realities.
		- Can the truth be the mix of these two theories? **Is it possible to switch between these realities and our consciousness decides which world we are gonna end up in?** Many of the other theories can be backed up by this one, like Mandela effect.
