# Idea

* Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon that occurs when <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">two or more particles become interconnected in such a way that their properties are linked together</mark>, no matter how far apart they are. 
	* These particles could be atoms, electrons, or even photons (particles of light).
	* For example -
	    - Lets say there are two identical boxes and two balls(one white one black) each box have one of the two balls.
	    - You shuffle the boxes and now you don’t know which box have which ball.
	    - One of the box is now sent on the moon.
	    - So there is now 50-50 chances of getting a white or black ball when you open the box on the earth.
	    - As soon as you open the box on the earth, lets say it comes out to be white, now you know that the box on the moon have the black ball.
	    - This information travelled faster than the speed of light in an instant, this shows the entanglement of the two boxes.
	    - As soon as we open one of the boxes the entanglement breaks. They are no longer connected.

# Interpretations

- Copenhagen interpretation
	- It states that <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">until the measurement is made there exists a wave of possibilities</mark> (wave like nature). 
	- When a measurement is performed all the possibilities collapses into one possible state
	- In our example - The possibility of existence of both the white and black ball in the box on earth exists at the same time, only when we open the box (measurement), both the **probability collapses, the entanglement is broken** and we get the white ball.
    
- Many world interpretation
	- According to this interpretation, <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">all possible outcomes of a measurement exist in separate branches of reality, creating a "multiverse." </mark>
	- Quantum entanglement is seen as a consequence of the branching nature of reality, where different outcomes are realised in parallel universes.
	- In our example - In our reality we got the white ball when we opened the box, there exists a reality in which when we opened the box we got the black ball. 
		- This means that when we observe the open box, we also gets entangled with these two, this entanglement is never broken, possibilities gets spread into different realities.
    
- Schrodinger’s cat
	- Imagine a cat inside a sealed box, along with a radioactive substance, a Geiger counter, and a vial of poison. 
		- The radioactive substance has a 50% chance of decaying within a certain time frame, and if it decays, the Geiger counter detects it and triggers the vial of poison to break, harming the cat.

    * According to Copenhagen interpretation the cat is both alive and dead before we open the box, as soon as we open the box, in that instant the decision is made.
    * According to Many worlds theory, since we are quantum mechanical too, so when we open the box there is no measurement, no wave function collapse, we simply gets entangled with the state of everything inside the box, so the person who see the cat alive and the person who sees the cat dead both are the same person but from different worlds.

- My Interpretation
	- When we open the box, its our consciousness that decides if the ball would be white or black or if the cat is dead or alive, more precisely our consciousness decides which world we are gonna end up in when the box is opened. 
	- Subconsciously it is decided by us only that the cat is alive or dead, which world we are gonna be a part of, its like the possibilities of anything and everything that can happen is just lies there and our brain decides which one it picks. 
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Our brain is the master of all the creation for us.</mark>
