# Idea

- Quantum physics explanation
	- When it comes down to the quantum physics, the wave like nature of everything is true.
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration (Nikola Tesla)</mark>
	- Everything and anything broken down upto the last detail comes out to be the energy and vibration.
	- It is already proven that out consciousness is capable of emitting these same energy and vibration, meaning our consciousness is capable of creation. 
	- It drives the nature of one’s own reality.
    
- Multiverse explanation
	- The multiverse does not branch and all those science fictional stuff, there are fixed number of multiverses (though large) with all the probabilities that can happen and will happen.
	- Instead of thinking it like numerous straight lines which can branch, think of it like an “n” dimensional matrix, the “n” here is the total number of conscious being there can exist in the multiverse.
	- Each column is a universe and each row is a time frame (the time dilation can be explained here by the speed of that consciousness can move in that particular space, how the time is calculated is not being calculated here)
	- **Each consciousness decision can move between these these universes**, <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">even a very small decision can have us end in a completely different reality</mark>. 
	- One consciousness can move in a specific vector, that vector is a 2d vector and the dimension that can move in is a 2d dimension. 
	- In rest of the dimensions a different version of the same consciousness exists.

	* <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">The normal flow of the time determines the speed and the consciousness decides the direction</mark>, the change in directions can lead to change in the reality itself.
	* We can only move in this 2D matrix only, rest of the dimensions are not accessible to us.
	* If we somehow break this and move in other dimension, we can find a different version of ourselves.
	* This is a simple explanation of a very complex thought.
    
- GOD explanation
	- The soul generates the consciousness
	- The soul can be possessed by anything that have the ability to be conscious
	- The source of the soul is the GOD itself
	- We have the fragment of GOD in all of us, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">our consciousness is our GOD</mark>, it decides our fate.
    
- Key point
	- This theory satisfies the conspiracies like multiverse, Mandela effect, existence of god, time and fits perfectly in the whole puzzle. 
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Our decisions can affect the life that we live very much</mark>
	- Though some (**honestly most**) of the equation parameters in our life is constant but **we can play with the parameters we have control on and can end up in the best reality possible for us.** 
	- Remember there is a version of you that have it all figured out, that is a genius and disciplined in every aspect of his life, that one is the best version of you there is. 
	- You better beat him.
