# Idea

- While pursuing their dreams people lose sometimes.
	- When they lose they subconsciously makes an assumption that all of it was worth it
		- **its a defence mechanism** by the brain which protects them from the sorrow of losing
		- this is a bad habit.
- They are led into believing that they worked hard and its all that matters

- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Despair is must</mark> to push forward and become better that you were before
    - Instead of sugarcoating the bitterness of defeat, feel the despair take it to the heart and push forward.
    - A person who gets everything by shear luck won’t understand this, who didn’t had a taste of despair won’t reach new levels.
    - If you don’t acknowledge your current pitfalls and refuse to change your ways, you will stay where you are.
