# Idea

**Step 1 - Make a Command:**

- The universe is like a genie ready to grant your wishes, so make your request (within reason, avoiding wishes for immortality).
- Do not concern yourself with the "how"; that's the universe's responsibility, not yours.

**Step 2 - Believe:**

- Have unwavering faith that you deserve your wish and that it will be granted.
- Relax and trust that your wish will manifest, without worrying about the details of its arrival.

By envisioning and expecting your desired outcomes, you can shape your life intentionally.
# Examples

- Those who have achieved great things often declared their goals and had unwavering belief in their success.
- Consider driving a car at night
	- Headlights illuminate only a short distance ahead
		- Yet they enable you to travel hundreds of KMs easily. 
	- Similarly, in life, you only need to focus on the immediate future
	* Trust that the path will unfold before you.
- You don't need to know every detail of your life ten years from now
	- Just have a clear destination in mind and work steadily towards it
	- Focus on the near future.
- Believe in your journey
	- Even if you can only see a short distance ahead, and you will reach your destination without even realising it.
- Success isn't determined by genetics but by your thoughts.
	- If you believe that food will make you fat, it's your thoughts, not the food, that lead to weight gain.
	- The power of belief is evident in the example of someone who confidently proclaims, "I'm good with ladies," and consequently becomes successful with women because of their belief.
