# Idea

* An affirmative thought is significantly more powerful than a negative one, with some estimates suggesting it is 100 times more potent.
	- The advice is to fill your mind exclusively with positive thoughts.

# Examples

* If you think about things you don't want in your life like I don't want to be alone or I don't want to be poor, what the law of attraction perceives this as - loneliness and poverty. 
	* And that's what is attracted in our life.
	* To avoid this, shift your focus from what you don't want to what you do want.
* If you are complaining, the law of attraction will bring more things for you to complain about.
