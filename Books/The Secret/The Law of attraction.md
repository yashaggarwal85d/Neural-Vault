# Idea

- Our biggest obstacle in achieving the life we desire is often ourselves.
- Everything that enters our life is a reflection of our thoughts, which is the basis of the law of attraction.
    - The law operates continuously, without pause
    - Law corresponds to good and bad thoughts equally.
- "Thoughts become things," meaning our thoughts eventually manifest into reality.
- To manifest what we want, we should focus our thoughts on those desires.
- Meditation strengthens the law of attraction by enhancing our thought control and revitalising our body.
# Examples

* By consistently focusing on positive thoughts and visualising specific goals
	* such as achieving a fulfilling career, nurturing meaningful relationships, attaining vibrant health, or experiencing financial abundance
	* we can manifest these desires into our lives.
