* Nikola tesla said - "if you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of frequency, energy and vibration". 
	* The concept that everything in the universe vibrates is fundamental, from celestial bodies like stars and planets to the smallest particles such as those in our hair. 
	* When we break down matter all we find is the energy vibrating in different frequencies. 

* Albert Einstein said - "everything is energy and that's all there is to it, match the frequency of the reality you want and you cannot help but get into that reality. It can be no other way this is not philosophy this is physics".
	* Positive emotions like Love, joy and peace have **high** frequencies
	* Negative emotions like fear, sadness and sorrow have **lower** frequencies.
* Our thoughts emit frequencies similar to a radio channel
	* we can choose the frequency by changing our thoughts.
    - The transmission we receive is our life
	    - This transmission creates our life and the world around us.
	- The things you desire also vibrate at a frequency
		- Matching that frequency will attract them toward you.
