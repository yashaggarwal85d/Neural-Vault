	* Many people spend their whole life distrusting others
		* No one around them were honest or generous
		* Always being in company of wolves
		* These people yearns to be recipient of honest gestures
	* A series of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">calculated selective honesty</mark> can make them trust you
	* Selective honesty is best employed on your **first encounter**.
* **It is dangerous simply to ask for what you need**, no matter how politely
	* Unless the other person sees some gain for themselves, they may come to resent your neediness. 
		* In ancient China this was called "giving before you take"
		* The giving makes it hard for the other person to notice the taking. 
	* Generosity is also a great weapon
		* Few people can resist a gift, even from the most hated enemy (Trojan horse)
		* Gifts brings out the child in us, lowering our defences
* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">People see through a fake gesture</mark>

	* Unless you can **make the gesture seem sincere and heartfelt**, do not play with fire.
