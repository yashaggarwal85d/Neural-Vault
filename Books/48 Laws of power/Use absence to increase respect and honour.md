# Idea

* A strong presence will draw power and attention to you, you shine more brightly than those around you
	* There will be an aura around you
		* This <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">aura fades when they know too much about you</mark>.
		* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">The more you are seen and heard from, the more your value degrades</mark>
	* Force their respect by **threatening them with the possibility that they will lose you for good**
		* Create a pattern of presence and absence
		* Push and Pull
	* If you are established in a group, **temporary withdrawn** from it will make you more talked about, even more admired
	* Nothing seems private nowadays, so we are awed by anyone who is able to disappear by choice
* Once you die, everything about you will seem different
	* You will be surrounded by an aura of respect
	* People will remember their criticism of you, their arguments with you, and will be filled with regret and guilt.
	* <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">By completely withdrawn for a while, you create a kind of death before death</mark>
		* An air of resurrection will cling to you, and **people will be relieved at your return**
		* What withdraws, what becomes **scarce**, suddenly **seems to deserve our respect and honour**
* The law of scarcity.
	* <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">By withdrawing from the market you create an instant value.</mark>
	* Too much circulation makes the price go down
		* The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you appear.
* In the matters of love
	* **At the start of the affair you need to heighten your presence in the eyes of the other**
		* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">If you absent yourself too early, you may be forgotten</mark>
	* But once your lover's emotions are engaged and the feeling of love has crystallised, absence inflames and excites.
		* Giving no reason for your absence excites even more
		* The other person assumes he or she is at fault
	* While you are away, the lover's imagination takes flight and a stimulated imagination cannot help but make love grow stronger.
	* Conversely the more your pursue someone, you become
		* Too present, accessible, Suffocating, a habit and **taken for granted**
		* **Love never dies of starvation but often of indigestion**.
	* <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">The stronger and longer the disagreement, the sweeter the feeling that comes with peace at rapprochement</mark>.
* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">"Why have you not been to see me" is more sweeter than "Why have you come again"</mark>
