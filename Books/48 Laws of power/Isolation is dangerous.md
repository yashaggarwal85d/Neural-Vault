* The world is dangerous and enemies are everywhere, everyone has to protect themselves.
	* Isolation seems to be safest
		* But it exposes you to more danger than it protect you from
			* It cuts you off from valuable information
			* Makes you conspicuous 
			* Makes you an easy target
	* As in warfare and most games of strategy, **isolation often precedes defeat and death**
	* Better to circulate among people
		* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Seek out old allies, make new ones</mark>
			* Place yourself at the centre of things
			* **Force yourself into more and different circle**s
		* Shield from your enemies by the crowd
* <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Never imagine yourself so elevated that you can afford to cut yourself off from even the lowest echelons.</mark>
	* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">People might view your isolation as an insult</mark>
* Isolation is as **deadly for the creative arts** as for the social arts.
	* **Always prefer to show people what you are up to.**
* If you need time to think, <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">choose isolation in small doses</mark>
	* The more isolated you are, the harder it is to break out of your isolation when you choose to.
