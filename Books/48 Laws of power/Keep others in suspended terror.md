# Idea

* **People are always trying to read the motives behind your actions**
	* To use your predictability against you (like in chess)
		* Your predictability gives them a sense of control
	* Throw in a completely inexplicable move and put them on the defensive
		* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Be deliberately unpredictable</mark>
		* When people cannot figure out what are you doing they are kept in a state of terror
			* Waiting, uncertain, confused
	* Specially when you are cornered
		* Throwing a series of unpredictable moves can **confuse your enemies**.
* Predictability can sometimes work in your favour
	* By creating patterns for people to be familiar and comfortable with, you can lull them to sleep
		* This sets up a smoke screen, behind which you can carry on deceptive actions
		* It allows you on rare occasions to do something completely agains the pattern
	* When in a subordinate position
		* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Too much unpredictability will be seen as a sign of indecisiveness </mark>
