# Idea

* In your struggle for power **you will create enemies**, its inevitable
	* There are people who you cannot win over, Who will remain your enemy no matter what
		* Do not take their hatred personally
			* Just recognise that there is no possibility of peace between you
		* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Enemy may act friendly,</mark> Pay no heed to whatever friendliness they feign
			* To wait for them to show their card is silly
			* The Only peace and security you can hope for from your enemies is their disappearance
				* If they cannot be banished, at least understand that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">they are plotting against you</mark>
* If gotten a chance to destroy them, 
	* Do not **respect** your enemy,
	* Do not accept a **surrender**,
	* Do not **sympathise** or pity,
	* Do not hope for **reconciliation**,
	* <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Do not have mercy</mark>
	* We have beaten them
		* They are **humiliated**
		* The enemy will recover and will seek revenge.
		* **When they return they will bear more hatred.**
		* <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">A Viper crushed beneath your foot but left alive will rear up and bit you with a double dose of venom</mark>
	* Annihilation is the only option 
		* Crush them, not only body but in spirit.
		* To have ultimate victory you have to be ruthless.
* Sometimes its best to **let the enemy destroy themselves**
	* <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Only when you know there is no chance of recovery</mark>
	* Let them be the agents of their own destruction
	* The result will be the same and you won't feel half as bad.
* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">God may have mercy on my enemies, because I won't</mark>
