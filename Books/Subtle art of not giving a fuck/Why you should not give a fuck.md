# Idea

1. FeedBack loop of hell
    - <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">You feel stupid for making every mistake that you begin to feel stupid about how stupid you’re feeling.</mark>
	- This goes on and on leading to more anxiety, overthinking and all the bad stuff that you can feel about yourself.
    - **Social media is shit**
        - Social media is a supporter of feedback loop of hell.
        - Back in the day if grandpa used to feel low he would say - “I feel like shit today but guess that’s life, back to cycling with 100kg of luggage across the city”.
        - Now whenever we feel low we open instagram with hundreds of people living the most amazing and happy lives (which is actually just a front they are actually miserable in real life).
    - How to escape this loop?
        - <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">By not giving a fuck.</mark>
        - If you don’t give a fuck about that you feel bad, you basically short circuit the feedback loop, you say - “I feel like shit, but who gives a fuck”.
        - And just like that you stop hating yourself and all the bad feelings disappears.

2. Wanting a positive experience is itself a negative experience.
    - **The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.**
    - If you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become, as pursuing only reinforce the fact that you lack it in the first place.
        - The more desperately you want to be rich, the more poor you will feel.
        - **The more desperately you want to be in a relationship, the more lonely and unworthy of love you will feel.**
        - The avoidance of suffering is itself a form of suffering.
        - The denial of failure is itself a form of failure.
        - Hiding what is shameful is itself a form of shame.
    - What about the beach body I have been working out myself for?
        - <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">When you care less about something, you do better at it.</mark>
        - The person who is least invested in success of something actually ends up achieving it.
        - Sometimes when you stop giving a fuck, everything seems to fall into the right place.
    - Some suffering is always inevitable, that no matters what you do, life is comprised of failures, loss, regrets and even death.

3. Our crisis is no longer material, its existential, its spiritual.
    
    * Most of us struggle throughout our lives by <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">giving the fucks in the situations where fucks do not deserve to be given</mark>.
	    - We give too many fucks for the refund from burger king when it does not come.
	    - We give too many fucks about what our co-workers think about us.
	    - we give too many fucks why we are not rich and not banging a hot chick.
    - Why not to give a fuck?
        - We all are going to die one day
        - Everyone who we know and who know us are going to die one day.
        - **With the short amount of time we have, have have a limited number of fucks to be given.**
        - If you go around giving a fuck about everything and everyone without conscious thought of choice, then we are going to get fucked.
        - Those people whose opinion we cared about so much are not in our lives anymore (Take example of any girl you had a crush on and felt nervous around her).
        - **The rejections and pain have helped us evolve into a better man.**
        - Realise that how little attention people pay to the superficial details about us that we choose to obsess over.
        - Being selective about how much fucks to be given where is called Maturity.
    - Where to give a fuck?
        - We have to give a fuck about something in our lives. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">we just need to consciously and very smartly decide what we want to give a fuck about</mark> and what we are going to say fuck off to.
        - Do not care about pissing some people off to do what you feel is right or important (You are choosing to not give a fuck to those people and give the fuck to the thing that is actually important).
        - **You can’t be an important and life-changing presence for everyone, you are maybe a joke or embarrassment to others, but who gives a fuck to them.**
    - Why give a fuck?
        - If you find yourself starting to give a fuck about trivial shit in your life then that means there is not much going on in your life. 
        - And you need to change that

# Examples

* Sometimes people who are least interested into getting into a relationship are the ones who actually get into one the quickest, example - Tushar.
* Realise that you are never going to cure cancer or go to the moon or fuck Alexandra Daddario and thats okay. Life goes on.
* When a person has no problems, the mind automatically finds a way to invent some.
	* Take the example of Amma ji, she has no problems at all in her life, her children are all settled, her husband is devoted to her, she has no friends, or close relatives.
	- The only thing she could give a fuck about, is her one and only source of entertainment and that is making things up and causing fights in the household.
