# Idea

- VictimHood
    - The <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">responsibility fallacy</mark> allows people to pass off their responsibility for solving their problems to others.
    - This ability to alleviate responsibility through **blame** gives people a temporary high and a feeling of moral righteousness.

* Anger
    - Being mad or angry or having an <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">outrage is also a temporary high</mark>, it gives us the sense of righteousness and shifts our responsibility for that moment.
    - When the person later comes to the realisation of what he has done, he is filled with guilt and suffering.
    - Outrage is also like other highs that feel good but over time devours us from the inside out.
        - And the fact that we don’t recognise it as a pleasure makes it more insidious.


# Examples

* "My father is responsible for me being poor, he is to blame for my unhappiness." This is responsibility fallacy

- Outrage Porn
    - Rather than covering real stories and real issues,
    - The media finds it much easier and profitable to cover something mildly offensive,
        - broadcast it to a wide audience
        - generate outrage
    - And then broadcast that outrage back.
    - This triggers a kind of echo of bullshit pinging back and forth between two sides, distracting everyone from the real societal problems.
    - <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">That’s why watching news is the biggest waste of time.</mark>
