- What is Happiness
    - Happiness is not algorithmic
        - If i achieve X, I will be happy
        - If I look like Y, I will be happy
        - If I can be with Z, I will be happy
    - Happiness is not a solvable equation
    - It is a result of <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">solving a problem</mark>, problems never stops, so does the happiness, its a constant work in progress.
    - Avoiding a problem creates distress.
    - <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving.</mark>
    - A short lived happiness is called a **high**. It is a shallow and unproductive way to go about oneâ€™s life. A short term pleasure is released, which is addicting -
        - Deny that a problem exists.
        - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Blame others</mark> or choose to do nothing for your problem.
    - We are always working hard to change our life situation but we actually never feel very different
    - What pain you want to sustain determines your success. <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">You have to be in love with the process, not the result</mark>.
        - If you want a great physique, you have to be in love with going to the gym.
        - If you want to be in a relationship, you have to be in love with the conversation with a girl.
# Examples

- Happiness requires solving a problem, and solving a problem requires struggle.
	- If you want amazing physique you have to accept that pain and struggles of the gym.
	- If you want to have amazing sex, you have to go through tough conversations, awkward silences, rejections and maybe even heartbreak.
