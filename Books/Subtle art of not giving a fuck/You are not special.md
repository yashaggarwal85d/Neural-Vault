# Idea

- Are you special?
    - When something out of ordinary happens to people they becomes entitled.
    - They think they are unlike everyone else and that means the rules must be different for them. There are tow types of entitled people -
        - **I am awesome and rest of you sucks, so I deserve special treatment.**
        - **I suck and rest of you are awesome, so I deserve special treatment.**
    - Opposite mindset but the same selfish core.

- You are not special
    - The suffering/pain or success/happiness that you have got
	    - There a millions of people who got them.
    - Severity of pain or happiness is different in people’s life but everyone goes through it at some point or later.
    - <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">If everyone is special that just means no one is.</mark>

- Why you don’t need to be special
    - <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Social media</mark> and news feed us information about exceptional people that makes us think are we not good enough
        - but in reality these are just a facade to keep the masses working like slaves.
        - **The percent of people who are incredible successful are very less and you being one of them is quiet impossible (its the bitter truth)**
    - Successful people who says suff like
	        - “You can also achieve this”
	        - “Every person is extraordinary”
	        - “Money or beauty doesn’t matter”
		- and other similar shit are just a means to jerk off their ego.

- You are puny
    - Your <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">actions doesn’t actually matter in the grand scheme of things</mark>
        - you are gonna be forgotten past some years of your death but its okay
        - we are not supposed to be someone special.
    - The majority of your life is gonna be boring and not noteworthy and that’s okay.
    - <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Maybe being ordinary is not so bad</mark>
	        - simple pleasures of friendship
	        - watching your favourite TV show
	        - talking to parents
	        - going out for a movie
        - These are ordinary things and don’t sound very awesome but that’s fine because that is exactly what matters.
