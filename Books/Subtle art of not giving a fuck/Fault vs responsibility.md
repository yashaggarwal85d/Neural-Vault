* Fault vs responsibility
    - People hesitate to take responsibility for their problems because they believe that to be responsible for their problems is also to be fault for your problems.
	    - The fact is that these two may appear together but are completely different things.
    - **Fault is the past tense and responsibility is the present tense.**
	    - Fault results from the choices that have already being made, responsibility results from the choices you are currently making
    - <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Nobody else is ever responsible for your situation but you.</mark>
    - <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Many people may be to blame for your unhappiness but none is responsible for it.</mark>

- Play the cards you are dealt
	- We all are dealt different cards, some gets better cards than other. 
	- We got 2 options from here on out -
	    * To **sulk over** the cards dealt and blame the dealer(GOD) or the game(World).
	    * To **try to make the best choices** and moves possible with those cards.
	* The real game lies behind the risks we take and the consequences we chose to live with.
	* People who consistently make the best choices in the situations they are given are the ones who eventually comes out ahead.

# Examples

	- The judges in the court are not in the fault for a case but they are responsible for it.
	- You donâ€™t choose your crappy genetics, its not your fault but it is your responsibility.
