- What is suffering
    - Life itself is a form of suffering.
    - Pain and loss is inevitable. Resisting them only increases their intensity.
    - All suffering is not equal, some people suffers more that others but <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">all have to suffer</mark>.
    - Watching a movie where the hero dies in the end, you love it even more despite making you feel horrible, because it feels real. <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Suffering makes this world real.</mark>
- Suffering is biologically and Psychologically useful.
	- Its nature preferred agent to inspire change.
	- We are wired to become dissatisfied by what we have and satisfied by only what we don’t have.
		- The constant dissatisfaction ahas kept our species striving.
		- Its not a bug of human evolution, its a feature.

# Examples

* Everyone suffers
	* People in relationship suffers because of their relationship, people not in relationship suffers because they don’t have one
	- People having jobs suffer because of their job, people not having job suffers because they don’t have one.
- Suffering is necessary
	- Stubbing our toe to a table talks us how to walk
	- Rejection or failure enforces us to not to commit same mistakes in the future.
	- These are the healthy doses of pain that helps us to evolve.
* Our problems are unavoidable and recursive.
	- The person you marry is the person you fight with.
	- The dream job that you take is the job that you stress over.
