# Idea

- High self esteem
    * <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Research found that people who think highly of themselves generally performs better</mark> and cause fewer problems.
    * Does that mean you should think of yourself as some kind of god? 
	    * The answer is YES and NO.
    
    - You should obviously be confident in yourself and your abilities.
        - But this <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">confidence should have a limit,</mark> otherwise it will turn into arrogance.
        - Feeling exceptional and good about yourself all the times make you arrogant and arrogant people are jerks.
		    - If someone develop this mindset, its very hard to reason with them. Any Attempt is a threat to their superiority.
		    - They are never in fault, if something bad happens to them its always somebodyâ€™s else false, victim mentality kicks in.
		    - They never accept their mistake. They live in constant denial.
		    - This is called <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">entitlement</mark>. Its another high.
	- A person who actually has a high self esteem accepts their mistakes and faults. They try to improve themselves and never back down.
