# Idea

- Difference in painful and powerful
    - The only difference in you being powerful in the problem and problem being painful for you is that if we chose it or not.
    - If you are miserable in your current situation,
        - the chances are that there is some part of it that you **think** is out of your control
        - that you have no power over it or potential to change it
        - that the problem is thrust upon you without being choosing.
    - If we feel that our problems are being forced upon us against our will, we feel victimised and miserable
    - But <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">if we feel that we are choosing our problems, we feel empowered.</mark>

- We are always choosing
    - We don’t always control what happens to us but
        - we always choose how we interpret what happens to us
        - how we respond.
    - Whether we consciously recognise it or not we are always responsible for our experiences.
    - Choosing not to response is itself a response.

# Examples

- Its our responsibility
    - In Spiderman, uncle ben said -
        - “With great power comes great responsibility”,
        - but the reverse of this is also true - “With great responsibility comes great power”.
    - The more we choose to accept responsibility in our lives, the more power we will exercise over our lives.
- Studying
	- Feeling that you are forced to study makes the experience miserable.
	- Feeling that you want to study makes it much more bearable.
