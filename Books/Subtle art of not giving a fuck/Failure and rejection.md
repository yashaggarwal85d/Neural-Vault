# Idea

- Failure
    - **We are afraid to fail.**
	    - We instinctively avoid failure and stick only to what is placed in front of us or only what we’re really good at.
    - If <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">we are unwilling to fail, we are unwilling to succeed</mark>
        - we can be truly successful only at something we are willing to fail at.
    - If failure happens, pain is inevitable and necessary.
        - Just as one must suffer physical pain to build a stronger muscle,
        - one must suffer emotional pain to develop greater emotional resilience.
    - If we want to excel at something, we have to try, we will fail few times, we learn from that then we will succeed.

- Do something
	- If you are stuck on a problem
	    - Don’t sit and think about it, just start working on it.
	    - Even if you don’t know what you are doing, the simple act of working on it will eventually cause the ideas to show up in your head.
    - It is proved that the Action isn’t just the effect of motivation, it’s also a cause of it. Its like -
	    - **Inspiration → Motivation → Action → Inspiration**
	    - Its a cycle.
        
- Rejection
    - <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Rejection makes our life better.</mark>
    - If we have strong values then anything that oppose those, we must reject.
    - Avoidance of rejection, both giving and receiving, is just a way to make ourselves feel better, its an another high.
    - Rejection is a skill. We have to become comfortable in saying the word “no”.
