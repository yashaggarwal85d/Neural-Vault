- Self Awareness Onion
	* There are multiple layers of self awareness, its like an onion. The more you peel, the more you cry and the more deep you get.
	
    - **Layer 1 : Understanding One’s emotions**
        - Analyse and understand what makes you feel certain emotions.
	        - This is when I feel happy
	        - This is when I feel sad
	        - This gives me hope
	        - I love this
	        - I hate this

    - **Layer 2 : Why we feel certain emotions**
        - Ask yourself these questions
            - Why do I consider something success or failure.
            - Why I feel angry.
            - Why I feel Lazy.
            - Why I feel horny
        - Ask yourself every time you feel a particular emotion, try to get in the depth of the reasons that make you feel these emotions.

    - **Layer 3 : Values**
        - <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Values underlie everything we think or do.</mark>
	        - Its a metric for what are we gonna feel when something happens.
	        - If you want to change how you see certain situations, you need to change your measure of success or failure and your values.

- Choosing Values
    * <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Self improvement is about prioritising better values. Choosing better things to give a fuck about.</mark>
	    * Better values → better fucks → better problems → better life.

# Examples

* Value matters
	* Metallica kicked out Dave
		* He created a new band Megadeth which sold over 25M albums, Metallica sold over 180M albums in its lifetime.
			- **Metric 1** - If his value/metric for success is selling more albums that the band which kicked him out. He was a FAILURE.
			- **Metric 2** - If his value/metric for success is simply doing good in his carrier, he was a SUCCESS.

Lets analyse if something is a good value to have or not -
* Pleasure
	* Pleasure is great, but is terrible to prioritise your life around it. Its a false God. Its just a high. Easily to obtain and easy to loose.
	* Material success
		* Research shows that once one is able to provide for basic physical needs, the correlation between happiness and worldly pleasures approaches zero. 
		* If your value of success is material then that’s a shitty value
	* Always being right
		* Obviously a shitty one
	* Honesty
		* Diamond
	* Staying positive all the time
		* Its an another high
		* accepting one’s negative emotions is a good value
	* Self respect
		* Gold
