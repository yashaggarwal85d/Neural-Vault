- Why to admit?
	- If you know that you are wrong and they are going to find it out then isn’t it better to **accept your mistake**. 
	- It is much **easier to listen to self-criticism** that to bear condemnation from the alien lips.
		- Say all the derogatory things that you know the other person is thinking or intends to say. Say them before they have the chance to say it. 
		- The chances are that they will develop a forgiving attitude and your mistakes will be minimised.
    
- Why not defend?
	- If you don’t have an excuse say “There is absolutely no excuse for my blunder”
	- Defending the situations like these is futile, you will only receive resentment and a tough scolding but if you admit your mistakes before they do you becomes the noble who admits his mistakes.
	- By fighting you can never get enough but by yielding you get more than you expected.
