# Idea

- The sweetest sound
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">A person’s name to that person is the sweetest and most important sound in any language.</mark>
	- Drop the name of the person on the conversation regularly (Just like Prasanna).
	- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Don’t make it creepy by overusing the name</mark>, drop it randomly between sentences. 
	- People are going to like you more for this very simple fact
		- you will receive more attention, respect and love.
    
- How to remember names
	- Never forget a name, the easiest way to remember a name is to **repeat it as soon as you hear it.** 
	- Drop the name in between the initial conversations.
	- Remembering a person’s name is the most basic thing to do for that person, even if you forgot the name ask for the complete name, make it look like you knew their name, you just wanted to know their surname.
