- How to get your opponent to say “YES”
	- **Think in the perspective of the other person**
	- understand their viewpoint and let them know what you are understanding
		- Repeat the points that they have just stated, they will agree because that is their view
		- keep them saying YES YES
		- slowly and swiftly take them from their point of view to yours.
			- The change will be more acceptable if done slowly. 
		- Without realising it your opponents will find themselves agreeing to a conclusion they would have bitterly denied.
    
- Don’t let them say “NO”
	- A **“NO” is a barrier**, that leads to widening of the gap between you and your opponent
		- it will be difficult to get your opponent to the same path as yours if this gap keeps on increasing.
		- Starting with the perspective of your opponent and slowly building the path between you is like a humble invitation for them.
