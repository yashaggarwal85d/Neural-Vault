- What happens in an argument
	- An argument happens when two parties disagree on some topic and they put their views and decide the solution. 
		- But most of the arguments don’t go that way, they become messier.
	- In an argument **90% of the time both parties end up either believing they are absolutely right or hating each other**.
	- Even if in 10% cases you become victorious, that victory is hollow
		- the other person now most likely have less respect for you than before.
	- You maybe dead right but changing the other person’s mind is something that requires real skill.
	- Sometimes the state of mind that the person is in is so different from yours that you can never convince them.

Hatred is never ended by hatred but by love and a misunderstanding is never ended by an argument but by diplomacy and sympathetic desire to see the other person’s viewpoint.
    
    
- Yelling
	- When people yell they just make a fool out of themselves
		- When two people yell at each other there is no communication, just noise and bad vibrations. 
	- When one yells, try to listen calmly. 
		- In most situations if you do not yell back and reply calmly, the other person will also calm down. 
		- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">The power dynamics support the one who is calm.</mark>
	- Remember, in an argument <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">its not YOU VS THEM, it is (YOU & THEM) VS PROBLEM</mark>.
