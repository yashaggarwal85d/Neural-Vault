* Mostly our first reaction to a disagreeable situation is to be **defensive.**
- We should be calm at that time, the instinctive reaction in these situations can be dangerous. Control your temper.
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">You can measure the size of a person by what makes him or her angry</mark>.
- **Try to understand what the other person is thinking**
	- **listen** properly
	- give them a chance to talk
	- let them finish what they want to say. 
- If you defend or debate at this time it will only increase the barriers and distance between the two.
- **Look for the areas of agreement**
	- Start with a common ground then build on it a bridge between the two, not the barrier.
- Really think on the arguments they are putting
	- **you may be actually wrong**, and if you are right put your arguments
	- Once the atmosphere is cooled down the truth can be revealed.
- Postpone the solution, to give both sides the opportunity and the time to think on the problem through.
* Be Diplomatic
