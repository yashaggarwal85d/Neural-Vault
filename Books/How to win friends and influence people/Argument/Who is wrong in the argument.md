- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">If there are any areas where you are wrong, admit them</mark>
	- This will disarm your opponent and most probably they will also admit the errors on their part.
	- No one will ever object you saying "I maybe wrong"
	- This will allow your opponent to be fair and open minded as you are. 
	- Most probably it will make them want to admit that they too could be wrong.
* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Never say “You are wrong”</mark>
	* Sometimes its easy to change their minds without heavy resistance or emotions, but when told that “You are wrong”, it make them resent the imputation and harden their hearts.
	* When we say these phrases to anyone, we are stripping them of their dignity and making the discussion more unwelcoming.
* When you are wrong admit them, when the other person is wrong try to persuade them
