# Idea

- Criticism
	- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Scolding is Foolish</mark>, its **negative conditioning.**
	- Criticism is futile because it puts the other person on the defensive and usually makes them strive to justify themselves.
	- **It will not change their mind rather they will just start to hate you**. 
	- Scolding also opens the door of lies.
    
- Appreciation
	- Do the opposite to criticism that is Praise
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">As much as we thirst for approval, we dread for condemnation.</mark>
	- This trick works one everyone, from children to adults. 
		- If you scold a child for a mistake it is very much probable that it will get repeated, you will get mad again and with time the affect of the scolding will die down, now your scolding does not affect them.
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Praising on the good things</mark> have the opposite affect
		- The thirst to get the good words out of your mouth again will raise the level of this ability each time and the good deeds will just increase exponentially.
	- Give honest and sincere appreciation, never criticise. Be hearty in your appreciation and lavish in your praise people will cherish your words and treasure them. This is **positive conditioning.**
	- Kindness, friendliness and appreciation can make people change their minds more rapidly than all the bluster and storming in the world.
    
<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">When dealing with people, let us remember that we are not dealing with creatures with just logical reasoning, we are dealing with creatures of emotion motivated by pride and vanity.</mark>

* Instead of condemning people lets try to figure out - 
	- What they are thinking, what is their psychology
	- Try to understand them
	- Figure out what they want
	- **Why they do what they do**
