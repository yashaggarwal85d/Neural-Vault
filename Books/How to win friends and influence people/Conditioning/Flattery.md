# Idea

* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Flattery does not work with intelligent people</mark>
	* It works with discerning people who are so hungry, so thirsty for appreciation that they will swallow anything just as a starving man will eat grass and worms.

| Appreciation         | Flattery              |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| Sincere              | Insincere             |
| Comes from the heart | Comes from the teeth  |
| Unselfish            | Selfish               |
| Universally admired  | Universally condemned |
