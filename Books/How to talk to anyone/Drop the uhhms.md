# Idea

* While listening to someone talk, we often vocalise “uh huh” or “hmm”. 
	* This becomes a habit and sometimes we just stops listening to the other person and do <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">unconscious humming</mark>.
* Don’t use “uhhms”, **employ empathisers**. Empathisers are simple, short and supportive sentences like -
	- I get that
	- Ohh so thats what happened
	- Thats really exciting
	- Yes, that was a good thing to so
	- I like that
- This impresses the listener and encourages them to continue. 
	- This also shows that you are a good listener and a better communicator.
