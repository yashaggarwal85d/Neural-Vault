# Idea

* <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Any two people have invisible scorecard hovering above their heads.</mark> 
	* The one with lower scorecard pays deference to other. 
		* Whenever you do someone wrong, even a little bit, you lose points
		* If you do a favour you gains points. 
	* You have to keep this scorecard balanced. 
	* **If the difference comes out to be too large, relationship over**.
