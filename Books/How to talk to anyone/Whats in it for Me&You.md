# Idea

* Whenever you are asking anyone for help
	* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Clearly define “Whats in it for me!” and “Whats in it for you”</mark>. 
	* By defining that these are the consequences of the deal you-
		1. Skipped beating around the bush
		2. Saved them the thought process of converting the request to “Whats in it for me”.
		3. **Saved their and your time**
		4. Laying your cards on the table, so removing the doubts of bluffing
		5. 100 points for <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">boldness</mark>
* Caution: this trick may not work for every situation, be careful where you use this.
	* You might not want to reveal everything!
* When asking someone for a favour let them know how much you appreciate the help given.
