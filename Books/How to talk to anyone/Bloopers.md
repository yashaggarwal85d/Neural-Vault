# Idea

* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Ignore bloopers around you. </mark>
	* Truly successful people never say “Whoops” or “Uh oh” or any other exclamation to bloopers. 
	* They simply don’t notice their comrade’s minor slips, spills, fumbles and farts.
* Let them suffer in silence
	* be oblivious of their small coughs and hiccups. 
* Don’t be oblivious to major bloopers like consistent loud rash coughs or consistent hiccups, should ask them if they are fine.
