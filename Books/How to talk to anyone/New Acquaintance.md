# Idea

- Big baby pivot
	- The instance you are introduced to someone
		- Give your new acquaintance a **warm smile**
		- A total body turn and the **undivided attention**.
		- This says to the new person - “Hey I have just met you and I think you are very special”
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Everyone is a baby inside</mark>
		- They all want the recognition and feeling of importance.
    
- Hello Old friend
	- When meeting someone,
		- If you imagine that they are an old friend of yours and by some miracle you two meet again
			- This feeling will effect your whole body language and your behaviour
		- This works on the basis of **self-fulfilling prophecy**
			- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">If you act as you know and like them, you really begin to like them</mark>.
