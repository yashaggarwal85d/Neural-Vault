# Idea

* <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">There are some places you should strictly not talk about work/favours</mark>
* If you are asking someone for a favour, lets say your uncle. You asked him for a referral in a company that they know their VP.
	* Never ask him the status of the request in type of situations where -
		1. **Parties** are for pleasantries and good fellowship, not for confrontations
		2. **Dining table**, eating habits does not include talking about tough business, its for brainstorming ideas and discussing joyful events
		3. **Chance encounters** are for chit chats, not to capitalise.

* Now you only talk about this when the time is appropriate because -
	1. You don’t want to interrogate them on the request
	2. Give them the time to think and get back to you
	3. You don’t want to embarrass them is they fail to comply the request
