# Idea

- Sticky eyes
	- Use this trick to seduce someone
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Glue your eyes on your target’s eyes</mark>
	- Look at them with passion
	- **Don’t break the eye contact even after she has finished speaking, break the eye contact ever so slowly and reluctantly.**
		- Like stretching of a chewing gum
    
- Epoxy eyes
	- This is for romantic seduction only
	- This involves <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">looking at the target even when someone else is speaking</mark>. 
	- **Watch the speaker but bounce to your target each time the speaker finishes a point.** 
	- The intensity depends on how much you want to push the target. 
		- Using this in moderation is advisable.
	- This basically conveys to the target that “<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">I can’t take my eyes off you</mark>”.
	- **These techniques only works on the women who find you attractive**,even a little bit
		- but if the attraction is zero then this trick will no more damage than good.
