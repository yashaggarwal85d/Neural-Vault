# Idea

* When you ask someone for a favour and they say “YES”, this is like a coupon or a voucher, 
	* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Don’t claim it immediately</mark>
		* Wait for some time (at-least a day). 
	* This is important because -
		1. You don’t wanna be seen as too **desperate**
		2. Give them some **time to prepare themselves** before actually making it happen
		3. Let them enjoy the pleasure of giving the favour.
	*  When you think the timespan is adequate, you can remind them of the favour and claim your voucher.
* When you grant someone a favour, its obvious that they owe you. 
	* <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Wait before you asks for a counter favour</mark>
		* Let them enjoy the fiction that you did it out of friendship. 
		* That you did it without giving it a thought
	* You know its not true, they know its not true but **only losers make it obvious.**
