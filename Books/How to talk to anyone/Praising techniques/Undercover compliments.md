# Idea

- Implied magnificence
	- Throw comments into your conversation that <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">presuppose something positive</mark> about the person you are talking with. 
    
- Accidental adulation
	- Make an assumption of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">if they were in your place they would have done it much better</mark>
	- These sentences give them **an illusion that we think they are great** and would have done better than us or are already ahead of us in some way. 
		- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Don’t overuse this technique because it can demean you in their eyes.</mark>

# Examples

* Implied Magnificence
	* Don’t tell your date - “Gosh, Mary, for a fat gal you dance real good”, the presuppose in this sentence was “Fat gal”, which screwed up the whole complement. Instead you can tell her - “**Gosh, Mary, was you a stage dancer you dance real good**”.
    - You can say - “Hey how are you? You obviously looks good”, presuppose here is that they look good.
- Accidental adulation
	- Tell your uncle - “At my age you would have knocked down that bully, but I didn’t do anything”
    - “You would have scored a 100 if you studied as hard as me”
