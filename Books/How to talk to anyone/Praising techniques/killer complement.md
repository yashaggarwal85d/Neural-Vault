# Idea

* A killer complement is commenting on some **very personal and specific quality** you spot in someone. 
* There are some rules for delivering killer complement -
	- Use the technique in **private**, in group situations this could be embarrassing to the recipient and weird for others.
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Complement should be credible</mark>, they are gonna know if you lie
	- Confer only **one killer complement per half a year on each recipient**.

# Examples

- What exquisite eyes you have
- You have very beautiful teeth.
- The aura around you is just so attractive and refreshing

# Similars
