# Idea

* A killer complement is commenting on some <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">very personal and specific quality</mark> you spot in someone. 
* There are some rules for delivering killer complement -
	- Use the technique in <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">private</mark>, in group situations this could be embarrassing to the recipient and weird for others.
	- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Complement should be credible</mark>, they are gonna know if you lie
	- Confer only **one killer complement per half a year on each recipient**.

# Examples
