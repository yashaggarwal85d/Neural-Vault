For explaining this techniques here is a short story -

- There was a little girl who often misbehave and her mother reprimand her. One day she didn’t do even a single thing that call for reprimand. The mother tucked her in bed and went away, later she heard cries.
- When she checked up on her daughter, she was crying, she said “Mummy haven’t I been a pretty good girl today?”.
- She was too quick to correct her when she was wrong but when she tried to behave she never noticed and put her to bed without one bit of appreciation

For your friends, colleagues and loved ones <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">appreciate them by giving a little stroke of appreciation</mark>. Words like - “Nice Job”, ”Cool”, “Well done Yash” matters a ton.

# Examples

* Blow me a kiss from across the room 
	* Say I look nice when I’m not 
	* Touch my hair as you pass my chair 
	* Little things mean a lot
