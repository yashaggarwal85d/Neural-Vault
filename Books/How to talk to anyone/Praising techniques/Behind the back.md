# Idea

* Instead of telling someone directly of your admiration, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">tell someone who is close to the person you wish to compliment.</mark>
	* This is the same path from which gossips and rumours travel from.
* This type of praise is also called **no risk praise** because the praise doesnâ€™t comes from you directly, so no malice.
* You will also leave the recipient with a happy fantasy that you are telling the whole world about their greatness.
* Opposite is also true, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">never do back-bitching</mark>.

* Become the carrier pigeon
	* People loves anyone who carry good news, specially when the good news is about them. 
		* Whenever you hear something complimentary about someone, fly to them with the compliment.
	* Opposite is also true, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">never carry a bad news</mark>.
