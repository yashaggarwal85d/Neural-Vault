# Idea

* Do a little research before the get together on the type of crowd and hot stuff popular among them.
# Examples

- If you are meeting with a bunch of accountant, read the new stuff related to their field.
- When you are meeting a couple of college students, you can have your brother who is in a college explain a little about whats hot going on in their age group.
- If you are going to buy something like a mattress or a computer component, before going to the shop you want to buy from, first go to the shops that sell that same equipment, get to know the price and industry knowledge.
