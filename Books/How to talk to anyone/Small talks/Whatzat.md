# Idea

* Wear a Whatzat, **wear something that is different and noticeable**, people may want to talk to you but they are not getting anything to start or continue. 
	* If you wear something that is unique it gives them a chance to talk on it.
* Be a Whatzit seeker too
	* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Seek something different and unique in other person</mark>
	* Start the conversation with that or bring it up between the conversation.

# Examples

* Remember when you wore hat on the airport
	* you talked to more women than you did in the whole lockdown period.
