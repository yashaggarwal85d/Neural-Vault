# Idea

* <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Start every appropriate sentence with “YOU”</mark>
	* It immediately **grabs the attention of the listener.** 
	* People most of the time are thinking about themselves, when a sentence is phrased to highlight their part in it, it saves them the time to think about it, a faster and a positive response is expected.
# Examples

- “Thats a good question” → “You have asked a good question”
- “I like your dress” → “You look good in that dress”
- “Can I take tomorrow off boss?” → “Can you do without me tomorrow?”
- “I know a really good french restaurant, will you join me there?” → “You will love this french restaurant, will you join me there?”
