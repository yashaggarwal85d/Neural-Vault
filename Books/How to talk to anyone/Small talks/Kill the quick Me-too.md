# Idea

* Whenever someone mentions a common interest or experience
	* Instead of jumping in with a breathless, “Me, too” or “I knew that” or “Same thing happened with me”
	* <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">let you conversational partner enjoy talking about it</mark> 
		* Then when the time is right, casually mention that you share the interest or experience.
* While you bite your tongue, think about their reaction when you reveal you share the same experience.
* **While revealing do mention that you enjoyed hearing about it.**
* Don’t wait too long for revealing the common interest
	* Tell them before you shift on to the new topic.
