# Idea

* When someone is saying something and is aborted by someone else or any other situation, let the interruption play itself out. 
	* Give the time to the interruption, after that <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">get back to the person</mark> who was telling the story, simply say, “**Hey, what happened after the …**” or if you don’t exactly remember the last phrase, say “**So, hey continue your story**”. This trick has several advantages to it -
		1. You save the speaker from the terrible feeling that they didn’t got to finish their story.
		2. You show that **you were listening**
		3. It shows that you care about them and is really interested in the story.
