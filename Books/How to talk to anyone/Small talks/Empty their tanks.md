# Idea

* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Let the other person talk out the fullest</mark>, hold your horses before you say or reveal something
	* let them empty their tanks and then deploy your message. 
	* This is useful in situations like -
		1. The other person is **complaining**, listen to them carefully and then give a empathetic reaction to it.
		2. You have a **customer**, you just donâ€™t want to tell them everything about your product, let them ask some questions.
