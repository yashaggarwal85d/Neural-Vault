# Idea

* If you want to talk to someone who you donâ€™t know directly but have an indirect connection
	* **Ask the connector to tell you about them or introduce to them.**
# Examples

* Lets say at a gathering you saw a girl and you want to talk to her, then you also notice that your friend knows her
	- Just ask him to introduce you to her or tell you anything about her.
		- Maybe not just her, it will reveal that you are targeting her, ask for couple of people.
	- Lets say he told you that she is from VIT vellore and working in google
		- There you have it, this is enough info to get a convo started.
	- You can approach her and introduce yourself and tell her that your friend told you about her that she is from VIT. Then start talking about VIT and google
