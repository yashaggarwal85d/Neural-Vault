# Idea

* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Never ask this plain statement</mark> “What do you do?”. 
* This is very common and have several disadvantages, it label you as-
	- A ruthless networker
	- Gold digger
	- Social climber
* **Sometimes people are not comfortable in explaining what they do.**
* The another question that we should ask instead of that is <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">How do you spend you most of your time?</mark> 
* Its a charming way to let them allow to say whatever they want to tell about themselves.
