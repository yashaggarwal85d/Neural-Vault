- Why Smile?
    * ***Action speaks louder than words**, and **a smile says, “I like you, you make me happy, I am glad that you are here”**
    * Smile is the best form of introduction.
    * <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Smile from your heart</mark>
	    * When you do that the smile comes through in your voice
	    * Even if the person is on the phone, they can sense your happiness if the smile comes from the heart.

* Flooding Smile
	* Smiling is good but smiling too often or smiling without any reason is abnormal and creepy. 
		* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Smile moderately</mark>
		* Fine tuning your smile is also essential.
		* Anything that becomes too available, gets cheap
	* A warm big smile is an asset only when it comes little **slower** because then it has more credibility. 
		* It will appear more sincere and personalised for the recipient.
		* It will make them feel special, important and just for them.
	* **Don’t flash an immediate smile when you greet someone**
		* <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Look at the other person’s face, pause, soak in their persona </mark>
		* Then let a big, warm and responsive smile flood over your face and overflow into your eyes.
