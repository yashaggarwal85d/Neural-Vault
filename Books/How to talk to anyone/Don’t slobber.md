# Idea

* When you meet someone special(maybe a past classmate) or famous(maybe a TV actor or insta celeb)
	* Stay cool, be calm, talk to them but hold your horses
		* Control your excitement and give them space. 
	* They are a normal human being at the end of the day, they are not that special or unique as much as you think.
* **If you are with someone in this situation, they will also appreciate your calmness and way of handling.**
