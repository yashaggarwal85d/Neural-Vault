# Idea

* When you meet someone special(maybe a past classmate) or famous(maybe a TV actor or insta celeb)
	* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Stay cool, be calm</mark>, talk to them but **hold your horses**
		* Control your excitement and give them space. 
	* At the end of the day, <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">they are a normal human being</mark>
		* They are not that special or unique as much as you think.
* **If you are with someone in this situation, they will also appreciate your calmness and way of handling.**
