# Idea

* **Drop the overworked words that everyone uses everyday,** words like good, pretty, nice, smart, bro etc.
* <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Have a complex synonym for each of these common words</mark> and replace them with that, this technique have several advantages -
	- People will think your english is better
	- You are a **better communicator**
	- You will stand out from the common crowd
	- Improves **attraction**
* 50 common words makes the difference between a rich and an average vocabulary.

# Similars

- Instead of saying pretty, say elegant
- replace wonderful with splendid
- If you want to compliment someone that they are smart, don’t say “You are smart”, say “That was ingenious” or “You are clever” or “resourceful” or “remarkable”.
