# Idea

* Watch the body movements of the person you are talking to, **imitate their style and movement.** 
	* Don’t imitate the bad things about them, only the ones you like. 
	* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">If someone gives hi-fis often, copy that habit when around them, give them a hi-fi whenever you have the chance.</mark>
* Copy their linguistic techniques too. 
	* Listen to their choice of nouns, verbs, adjectives and echo them back to them. 
	* Hearing their words from your mouth make them feel that you share their values, attitude and interests.
	* If they are interested in football, use the words goal, red card, yellow card, league etc. in your normal conversation.
* Evoke your listener’s interests or lifestyle and weave images around it. 
	* Use analogies from your listener’s world. 
	* This give them a hint that you share their interests and invoke likeness.
