- In a group conversation, the sweetest sound one can hear from your mouth is “**Tell them about that time you….”**
	- This is a very effective technique that will make the person you are targeting like you more, by putting the spotlight on them.
	- You did two things -
	    - You gave them a recognition that the story they are going to tell is a good one
	    - And by not telling the story yourself you made it clear that it would be more interesting if they are the one who says it, hence giving them another layer of recognition.
- Warning: Make sure that the story that you insisted them to tell is the one in which the teller shines, it should not be an embarrassing one. 
	- Otherwise the effects will be as strong and negative.
