# Idea

* The **spotlight of the conversation should never be on you** 
* Keep the topics of the conversation on them. It have 2 advantages -
	- You will come out as a **good listener**
	- Your side of the story is still a **mystery**, and mystery induces attractiveness.
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">To be interesting, be interested</mark>
- The longer you keep the spotlight on them, the more interesting they will find you.
* Do not think about yourself or how are you coming as 
	* <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">just focus on the other person</mark>
	* look at their reactions and then plan your next moves accordingly.
* Be a word detective
	* Listen carefully what your conversational partner is saying and try to figure out what are they most interested in
		* It is bound to slip out
		* Try to catch it and direct the conversation towards that, they would love to talk about that.
	* If they mentions something that is a little bit out of the conversation that you guys are having that can mean that they want to talk about that.
# Examples

In a chess game if you just focus on yourself, you will most certainly lose, you need to keep focus on the other player
