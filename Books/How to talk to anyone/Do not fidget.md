# Idea

* When in conversation, let your nose itch, your ears tingle 
	* But <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">do not fidget </mark>or scratch and **keep your hands away from your face**
		* Any hand moment near your face is a fidget. 
* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Fidget shows lack of confidence and trust.</mark>
