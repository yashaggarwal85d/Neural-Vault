# Idea

* When you want someone to become less of a stranger to you
	* Search for some special moment you shared during your previous conversations. 
	* Then find a few words that reprieve the laugh, warm smile, good feelings the two of you felt.
		* Use these every time you guys see each other.
		* This refreshes the good old memories and now you have your little thing going on, just the two of you, no-one else. You have some history together now.

# Examples

* <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Like Ted and Robin from “How I met your mother”, They have “Major” thingy common between two.</mark>
* A special hifi

# Similars
