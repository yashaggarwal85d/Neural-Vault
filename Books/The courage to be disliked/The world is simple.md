- **Why the World is Complicated**

    - **Transition from Childhood to Adulthood**
        - As children, the world appears simple.
            - Children are not burdened by adult responsibilities such as taxes, work, or complex relationships.
            - They are protected by their parents and society, free from many worries.
        - However, as one matures into adulthood, the world's complexities become apparent.
            - The fairy tale ends, and perspectives change drastically.
            - Adults face various challenges and problems, both at work and at home.
            - They encounter discrimination, inequality, loss, and rejection.
    - **Shift in Religious Influence**
        - Salvation was an option because the teaching of the divine was everything to us.
            - We just had to obey them and there is little to worry about.
            - With nothing to rely on, everything is filled with anxiety and doubts
    - **Existence of Atrocities**
        - The world is filled with atrocities.
            - Crimes, exploitation of the poor by the rich, and people suffering for entertainment are common.
            - Masses are often manipulated, and animal cruelty is widespread.
            - A constitution which is not equal for everyone, governments trying to loot their own citizens, countries at war.
	        - The world is not fucked up now, it was like this from the beginning of the time and nothing can fix this.
- **Why the World is Not Complicated**
    
    - **Subjective Nature of Reality**
        - <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">How the world is not a objective opinion, its a subjective one</mark>.
        - Individuals attribute meaning to the world based on their perspectives.
    - **Perception Shapes Reality**
        - People see the world through their own lens.
        - Perception influences how one experiences and interprets the world.

# Examples

- Water maintains a constant temperature of about 18 degrees.
	- However, the perception of this temperature varies.
	- In summer, the water feels cool, while in winter, it may seem warm.
	- Despite the objective temperature, individual experiences differ based on perception.
- As Dolores from Westworld says
	- Some people choose to see the ugliness in this world, the disarray.
	- I choose to see the beauty. 
	- To believe that there is an order to our days, a purpose.
