# Idea

**Our Brain and Education:**
- Our brains are wired by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">reward and punishment-based education</mark>.
- Without praise, we may not take appropriate action.
- Without punishment, we may engage in inappropriate actions.
- This lifestyle is a mistake.

**Living for Yourself:**
- If you're not living for yourself, who are you living for?
- Not for family, friends, or lovers, but solely for yourself.

**Interpersonal Relationship Troubles:**
- All relationship issues stem from intruding on others' tasks or having our tasks intruded on.
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Separation of tasks</mark> is crucial.
    - Always ask, "Whose task is this?" and separate accordingly.
- Intervening in others' tasks makes life heavy and full of hardship.
- However, non-interference is also incorrect.
    - Offer all possible assistance, but avoid intruding beyond that.

**Denying the Desire for Recognition:**
- Many seek recognition by satisfying others' expectations.
    - There's no need for <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">external recognition</mark>.
- Accept that others may not act as you wish without getting angry.
    - It's natural; it's their task to act as they wish.
- Choose the best path for your life without worrying about others' judgments.
    - Others' judgments are their choice and task.
- Don't fear being disliked.
    - Strive to be your best self; if others still dislike you, it's their task.

**Forming Good Interpersonal Relationships:**
- A certain degree of mental <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">distance is necessary</mark>.
- Too little distance leads to sticking together, possibly resulting in fights.
- Distance shouldn't be too great either.
- Maintain a moderate distance.
- Separation of tasks isn't about keeping others away but a way to untangle complex interpersonal relations.
# Examples

* If the main point of your job turns out to be satisfying other people's expectations, then that job is going to be very hard for you.
	* Because you'll be worried about other people looking at you and fear their judgement and you are repressing your "I-ness"
* You lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink.
	* If you try to make him drink forcefully, it will kick you only.
* You are worried about how people look at you because you haven't done the separation of tasks yet
	* Its their task to judge you, or pass a comment, its not in your hands
	* Considering their feedback as destructive or constructive is your task
		* Acting upon that is your task
		* Not getting angry or upset for that comment is your task.
	* You don't need to deal with anyone's unreasonable anger that one might try to vent at you. 
		* Its their task to vent all that anger at you
		* And its your task to ignore that!
* Distance matters
	* When parents scold their children too much, they become distant.
		* Now the child cannot consult his parents.
		* Parents could not trust the child
	* Lovers get too close to each other
		* Even small things might lead to big fights.
		* Separation of tasks is not there
