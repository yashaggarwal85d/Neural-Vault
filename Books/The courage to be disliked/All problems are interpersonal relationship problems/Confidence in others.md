# Idea

* We can believe or we can doubt, its our choice and it should be clear.
	* If you place doubt at the foundation of your interpersonal relations, you will live doubting other people.
		* <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">People may detect doubt in your eyes</mark>, they will understand that this person does not have confidence in me.
			* No positive relationship can be build from that point.
			* Confidence in other people is required as a foundation for deep relationship.
				* People with which you have these kind of relationships are called <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">comrades</mark>
	* People who have confidence in you no matter how they are treated, would you be able to betray such a person again and again? No
	* If one believes in others without setting any conditions whatsoever, there will be times when one gets taken advantage of.
		* Have confidence in people but <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">be prepared if a betrayal happens</mark>
		* Complete trust should not involve blindness to the other person's actions.
