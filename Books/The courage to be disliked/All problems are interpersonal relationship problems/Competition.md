**Pursuit of Superiority**
- Definition: The mindset of advancing independently, not by comparing oneself to others.
	- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Comparison with Others is Unnecessary and futile</mark>
	- Comparison should be with oneself only.
    
**Pain Caused by Competition:**
- Winners and losers emerge
	- If you Lose: Perceived as being looked down upon, leading to mistrust, animosity, <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">perceiving others as adversaries</mark>.
	- If you win: Brings no peace, as others may resent your success, hindering celebration.
		- Loser see you as an enemy now

Do other people look at you so much?
Are people lying in wait for the perfect moment to attack you?
Highly unlikely, unless you are a raw agent in Pakistan

**Alternative**
* Once you start dropping the competition and <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">see people not as enemies but as comrades</mark>, you will not have any interpersonal relationship problem ever.
