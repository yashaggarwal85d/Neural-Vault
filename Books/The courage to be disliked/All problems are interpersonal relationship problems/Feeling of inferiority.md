# Idea

##### Feeling of inferiority
* Feeling of inferiority is not objective its subjective.
	* The good thing about subjectivity is that you have the power to change that. 
	* Its your decision to view it as inferior or just another trivial thing that doesn't really matter.
* There is nothing wrong in having this feeling.
	* It might become a fuel for growth and development.
	* We all are in pursuit of superiority since we are born, and this feeling can help us enter into the condition of wanting to improve.
		* To get rid of this feeling people push themselves harder everyday, one more step, just a little better...

##### Inferiority complex
* Having a feeling that "I am not good enough anyway".
* Complex refers to an abnormal mental state made up of a complicated group of emotions and ideas.
* Its a completely different approach than the feeling of inferiority.
	* It shows a destructive mindset.
	* No prospect of future improvements.
	* Consistent feeling of being inferior and helpless.
* Its scary for them to even take one step forward.
* Courage is required to overcome Inferiority complex and actually make a change


# Examples

 * My colour is darker than the rest of the people, I have a feeling of inferiority.
	* The issue here is not the darker colour but the meaning that I give it, its completely subjective.
	* Some people might have the same subjective opinion that having a darker colour is bad or inferior but at the end of the day its a subjective option and has nothing to do with the objectivity of the matter.
	* Maybe having this feeling will lead you to have a better skin care routine and end up with a very good skin that you wouldn't been able to achieve without this feeling!
* Having a mindset that My skin is dark, so I can never look good.
	* You will end up hating your colour and yourself for being born that way.
	* You may even curse your genetics or your parents for that.
	* You might end up with the shittiest skin ever because you never had the courage to actually do something for it and now you look as bad as your aunt in 60s.
