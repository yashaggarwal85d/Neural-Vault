# Idea

##### Anger
* Anger is not an innate or natural emotion but rather a construct or creation of the mind. 
	* Anger is not something that happens to us involuntarily but is instead a result of our thoughts, beliefs, and perceptions.
	* Anger is created for a purpose to be fulfilled like shouting or screaming or hitting someone.
		* You don't shout because you are angry, you shout because you want to shout and fabricate anger in the process.
			* There could be numerous reasons behind that goal
* Anger is a weapon, it can be easily taken out as needed or put away. But be careful as you use it because when you use weapons like these, they ofter leave scars.
##### Trauma
* We do not suffer from the shock of the experience (Trauma) but instead we weave them out however they suit out purpose.
	* The meaning we give our past experiences determines our self being.]
	* Trauma is fabricated as an excuse to out goals, goals that are created because of the past experience but can be changed with minimal effort.

##### Dislike
* People are extremely selfish creatures capable of finding any number of flaws and shortcomings in others whenever the mood strikes them.
* You don't dislike the person X because they have a certain flaw that is unbearable to you. 
	* You dislike them because you want to avoid an interpersonal relationship with X.
* A man with perfect character could come along and one would have no difficulty in digging up some reason to dislike him.

*This is true with every emotion*
Just like a weapon inventory from a game, **we are always choosing** when, where and on whom to use these emotion.

# Examples

##### Anger
* Lets consider a situation in which a you are sitting in a restaurant with your crush and a waiter spills some coffee on your shirt by mistake, he apologises immediately.
	* Now here you are angry, why?
		* because the waiter spilled some coffee on you? NO
		* because the emotion of anger is being fabricated with the motive of shouting at the waiter.
			* The goal of shouting came because of other reasons
				* Maybe you want to make the waiter submit to you and listen to what you had to say.
				* Maybe you don't wanna come out as weak in front of your crush
				* Maybe you are expecting a compensation!
* Here the matter could be explained without the use of any instrument such as anger or shouting.
	* You could have just wiped that out, accepted the waiter's apology and continue to have a great time with your crush
	* You could have bargained for the compensation with the waiter in the private (if the stain was a permanent one) in the presence of manager, without making them feel embarrassed in front of everyone.
* A mother is not angry on her daughter for now doing the homework, rather she wants to make her daughter listen to her or embed a fear of getting yelled at when she not does her homework.
