# Idea

* <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Change can be uncomfortable and challenging</mark>.
* Our lifestyle may not have been consciously chosen by us. 
	* External factors like our environment and experiences can influence it.
	* What people generally do is to wish they were born as someone else because they don't like their current lifestyle
		* <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Wishing that you would be born in someone else's circumstances is a fallacy.</mark>
		* It follows aetiology.
	* Its entirely upto you to choose a new lifestyle now. 
* It takes courage to change.
* Word personality is misleading because it implies something as **unchangeable**

# Examples

* Subconsciously, you might believe that your current lifestyle is the most practical one, perhaps out of <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">laziness</mark> or its easier to leave the things as be. 
* You are choosing to not change your lifestyle and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">blame the past circumstances</mark> as an excuse to not change now. 
* You cannot predict the outcome of change, which can cause anxiety. To alleviate this, you choose to stop thinking about change altogether.
