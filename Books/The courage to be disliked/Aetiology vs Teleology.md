| Aspect   | Aetiology                                                | Teleology                                                     |

| Focus    | Causes or origins of things                              | Purpose, goals, or ends of things                             |
| Concern  | Reasons behind why something exists or occurs            | Intended outcomes or purposes inherent in a system            |
| Analysis | Sequence of events leading up to a particular phenomenon | End results or final states that something is directed toward |

* Focusing on Aetiology is cause of **determinism**. 
	* What this says that our present and future is already been decided by our past occurrences and are unalterable
* One should shift their focus from Aetiology to Teleology
	* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Think about the present 'goals' rather than the past 'causes'.</mark>

# Examples

So for rooting out any problem think in terms of teleology rather than Aetiology
* Lets assume a situation 
	* You are a person who was bullied by his classmates and now you are insecure and anxious about everything
	* You stay in your house all day long because you think that if you go out you will only get hurt
	* You want to go out but the **fear of getting hurt is more dominant than the wish of making relationships**.
* Rather than thinking about the cause of this, the bullying in school (Aetiology), one should see it through the lens of teleology
	* Your goal is now **not to go out**.
	* Now you are subconsciously manufacturing a state of anxiety and fear as a means to achieve that goal.
		* You are creating anxiety and fear as the reasons to stay inside
		* Maybe you think that by doing this my parents will worry about me and I will become their centre of attention.
	* The past experience has forces us to set this goal, as long as we stay in the past(Aetiology) the future is not gonna change. The only way to change is to construct a new goal of **I want to make meaningful connections with people**
	* It is impossible to not get hurt in relationships with other people, but you need to choose if the relationship is worth the pain or not.

A more simpler example can be
* Suppose you go to a doctor because you have a high fever and cold.
	* Now doctor starts saying that you have cold because you were out in the rain yesterday. 
	* That answer is not satisfactory and finding the cause of the problem helped little.
	* This is **Aetiological stance**. Most counsellors and psychiatrists would argue on this and end up by consoling you by saying its not your fault.
* Prescribing the medicine is the **Teleological stance**.
