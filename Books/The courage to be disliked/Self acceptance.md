# Idea

* **God grant me serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and wisdom always to tell the difference.**
    - One should focus on what can be changed rather than on what cannot.
        - Accepting things beyond our control is key to finding peace.
        - Directing efforts toward changeable aspects of life leads to progress.
    - Being content with oneself is important.
        - That doesn't mean one should not improve.
        - Continuous improvement is a lifelong endeavour.

# Examples

* Lets say you get a score of 60%.
	* If you say "The real me is 100%, I just happened to get unlucky this time".
		* This is self affirmation
		* You are in denial
	* If you say "I accept this 60%, now how should I go about getting closer to 100%"
		* This is self acceptance, with motivation to improve.
