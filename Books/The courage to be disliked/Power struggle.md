### Problem

- **Definition of a Heated Argument:** When an argument escalates, it goes beyond a simple disagreement.
- **Signs of Escalation:**
    - Both parties become unwilling to accept any differences in opinion.
    - The original agenda of the discussion is no longer the focus.
    - The other person may find you unbearable and resort to criticism and provocation, aiming to dominate the interaction through power struggles.
- **Aftermath of a Heated Argument:**
    - Even if you win the argument, there might be a revenge stage.
    - The other person, while temporarily withdrawn, may be planning retaliation in another place or form, preparing to reappear with an act of revenge.
### Solution

- **Dealing with a Power Struggle:**
    - When faced with a challenge or power struggle, step down the conflict as soon as possible. 
    - Avoid reacting impulsively to the other person's actions.
- **Effective Communication Strategies:**
    - Express thoughts and intentions in a <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">calm manner</mark>, aiming for acceptance without resorting to anger.
