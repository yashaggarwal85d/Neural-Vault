# Idea

There are only 3 reasons why a person hates himself - 
1. Unrealistic comparison
	1. You compare yourself to some other person *X* that you like.
	2. No matter how much you want to be like *X*, you can't be reborn as him
		1. And thats perfectly fine.
		2. The important thing is not what you are born with, but what use you make of that equipment
2. Guilt and shame 
	1. Either accept that as a mistake and forgive yourself as you are just another human being, you are not perfect, no one is.
	2. Or Atone for that
3. Habits
	1. Love the things that you like about yourself
	2. Change the things that you hate about yourself.
