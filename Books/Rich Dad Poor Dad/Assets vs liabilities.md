	* If you don’t like them you won’t take care of them.
	* Not always play it safe
		* Try all the options and perform necessary calculations to choose the best
		* If you play safe you risk the power of getting great profits, hence you see very less increase
		* If you don’t play safe you risk losses but may see large increases. 
		* In the end use your brain to make the decision.
* <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">First build your asset column and live off the money that those assets yield. All of your income goes into the asset column directly.</mark>
