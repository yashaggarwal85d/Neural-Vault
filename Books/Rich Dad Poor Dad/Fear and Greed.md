# Idea

- Most people’s life is being controlled by fear and greed. 
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Fear of not having money makes them works hard and fear of losing money makes them not want to invest.</mark>
- Most people want to play it safe and feel secure.
- People are so afraid to lose they do not try.
- The **pain of losing money is far greater than the joy of being rich**. Its analogous to “Everyone want to go to heaven but no-one wants to die”.
- Convert your fear into your power
	- This works for some who becomes successful and terrifies others.
- Greed gets people think about all the nice thing they could buy, this makes them stay in the rat race forever.
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Rich people buy the luxuries last, while poor and middle class tends to buy luxuries first.</mark>
- **Never buy the luxury on credit**, you may resent it someday. 
	- Build the asset column first and buy the luxuries from the income generated.
- The cure for laziness is a little greed. 
	- If you are not greedy at all you are not gonna work.
