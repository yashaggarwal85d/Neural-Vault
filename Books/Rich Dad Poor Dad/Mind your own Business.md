# Idea

* Do not spend your whole life working for someone else
	* corporate(employee), government(taxes), Bank(Mortgage).
* Your profession may be a software engineer but you still need your own business. 
	* **Side hustle is very important.**
* Starting a company or a startup is a very big task, 90% startups fails in 6 months and rest also fails eventually. 
	* Market is flooded with startups
	* <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Instead choose a side hustle that would not require your presence after some amount of time invested. </mark>
		* Algorithmic trading is a good example.
