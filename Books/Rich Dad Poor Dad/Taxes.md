# Idea

* <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The idea of taxes was made popular and accepted by the majority by telling the poor and the middle class that the taxes were created only to punish the rich</mark>
	* In reality it wound up punishing the very people who voted for it.
* The more is your salary, the more you pay the government.
* Rich donâ€™t pay taxes
	* They are smart, they find a way to avoid paying taxes.
