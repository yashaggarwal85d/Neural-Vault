- **Donâ€™t think about making it big in a single shot**. 
	- Keep an eye out for opportunities of making money.
- You can only surf the big wave only when you practise it on the smaller once. 
	- You can only profit from a big opportunity when you practice your investment skills on the smaller ones.
