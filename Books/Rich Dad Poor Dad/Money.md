* **Money is not real**, it is a illusion created by the rich to oppress the poor and middle class.
	- Banks can print money, they are making money out of thin air. 
	- It is a facade made to control people.
- **Saving money is a bad option**. 
	- It money is not compounding, its value is depreciating, investing money is the only option.
- Problem with the secure investments is that they are often **sanitised**, that is, made so safe that the gains are less.
- It is a gamble if you just throw in the money into a deal and pray for the returns but instead if you **used your brain** (financial and technical knowledge) before investing, its not a gamble its a strategy.
- Don’t be afraid of losing money
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Take the game seriously</mark>
	- Most importantly have fun.
- Instead of saying “I can’t afford it”, say “**How can I afford it?**”. 
	- This opens up the brain and force it to think all the possibilities which could lead to greater wealth.
