* Real estate strategy
	* **Start small and keep trading up for the bigger properties and delay paying taxes on the gain.** 
		* This allows the value to increase dramatically. 
		* Hold the real estate for less than 7 years. 
		* You will not be taxed on the gains until you liquidate.
	* Section 1031 in US allows seller to delay tax paying on the piece of real estate that is exchanged for a more expensive piece. 
		* Section 45 and section 45F are similar to the above in India.
	* <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">When the stock market investment becomes large, pull out the money, pay the capital-gains tax and then reinvest that money into real estate.</mark>
    
- Corporation strategy
	- **A corporation is merely a legal document that creates a legal body without a soul.** 
	- There are many benefits that a corporation enjoys over anyone -
	    - The income tax rate of a corporation is less than the individual income-tax rates.
	    - Instead of working the way up in the corporate ladder, own the ladder.
	    - Corporations pay expenses before taxes. This creates a huge difference in tax.
	    - Hide wealth using corporations or trusts to protect their assets from creditors.
	    - If someone sue you, your wealth owned by corporation which is owned by you is protected.
